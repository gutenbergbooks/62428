<p class="p2">Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The
fact that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely
due to the work of a specialist. The man who wrote
these stories produced no other type of fiction. His mind was
concentrated upon the creation of new plots and situations in
which his hero emerged triumphantly from all sorts of trouble,
and landed the criminal just where he should be—behind the
bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective
stories than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have
been selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend
each of them as being fully as interesting as any detective
story between cloth covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the
New Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise
and delight you.</p>

<br />
<small>AT A GAME OF POKER.</small></h2>


<p>Five men were playing cards in a room in the Old
Pike Inn.</p>

<p>It was a road house, on a well-traveled highway—a
great favorite with automobiles—in one of the picturesque
valleys that alternate with towering heights
within easy motoring distance of New York City.</p>

<p>The Old Pike Inn had its spacious verandas, its big
restaurant, its smaller dining rooms for private parties,
and its great reception hall, with polished floor,
in which dances, formal and informal, were in progress
every evening during most of the year.</p>

<p>It was a place to which wealthy New Yorkers often
brought their wives and daughters for luncheon or
dinner, and its “tone” was regarded as above criticism.
Everything suggested refinement, the lavish
expenditure of money for the comfort and entertainment
of guests, and an artistic atmosphere that was
both subtle and unmistakable. Captain Brown, who
managed the Old Pike Inn, knew his business.</p>

<p>Only a privileged number of his patrons were aware
that they could play a quiet game of “draw” in secluded
rooms, with the assurance that there could be
no interference, and where their occupation would
never be suspected by anybody not in the secret.</p>

<p>The five men playing were all young, and every one
showed in the flushed countenance that something
more than the excitement of the game had heated his
blood and rendered his speech at times somewhat thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Other evidence along this line was the fact that a
glass stood near each man, on a separate stand, while
bottles of liquor on a table within arm’s length of
the players were frequently brought into use by the
two soft-footed waiters, who were the only persons
in the room besides the gamblers.</p>

<p>There was very little talking. Men who play poker
are not apt to say much. Their attention must be
concentrated on the game, if they expect to hold their
own.</p>

<p>An occasional remark on some general topic was
uttered, but as a rule each player, holding his cards well
concealed in the hollow of his hand, watched the play
of the others, and sought, by strained vigilance, to
get the better of the struggle. Silence is a good thing
in a poker game.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as one of the waiters leaned over to
pour some liquor into one of the glasses, the person
for whom it was intended jumped to his feet and sent
the light stand to the floor with a crash—bottle, glass
and all. At the same time he pointed an accusing finger
at the man opposite him.</p>

<p>“Cheat!” he shouted.</p>

<p>At the ominous word, the other four men were also
on their feet.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Howard?” demanded one of them.</p>

<p>“He heard what I said, Jack!” thundered the other.
“Look at him! He knows he brought up an ace of
clubs from under the table. I saw him do it. He was
so clumsy that I actually was able to make out what
the card was.”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar!” cried the man accused.</p>

<p>It was useless for the others to try to keep the two
apart after that.</p>

<p>With a mighty sweep, he who had cried “Cheat!”
pushed the rather heavy table, with its green baize top
and its stacks of chips and scattered cards, to one side,
and leaped upon the man he had denounced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The two waiters were big fellows, notwithstanding
their ability to move noiselessly about the room. They
hurled themselves between the combatants.</p>

<p>Their interference was only just in time to prevent
a straight left from landing on the chin of the player
who had been charged with cheating, and at that, one
of them got the fist himself in the back of his neck.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Mr. Milmarsh!” begged the other waiter, as
he wound his arms around the waist of the infuriated
owner of the fist. “Don’t make a noise! They’ll hear
it downstairs. It’s a mistake! It must be!”</p>

<p>But Howard Milmarsh cared only for vengeance
just then.</p>

<p>“Get away, will you?” was all he replied. “If you
don’t, I’ll break your skull with a bottle. I’m going to
make that scoundrel over there confess, and then I’ll
thrash him till he won’t know that he ever had a face.
It never <em>will</em> be the same face again,” he added grimly.</p>

<p>But the waiter hung on to the young fellow, while
his comrade tried to push the other man back toward
the door of an anteroom where hung the coats and
hats of the players, and which was also fitted up as a
lavatory.</p>

<p>“Come back here, you white-livered cur!” shouted
Milmarsh. “You, I mean—Richard Jarvis! The fellow
who calls himself a cousin of mine! Come back
and let us look at what you have inside your cuff!”</p>

<p>The man he had called Richard Jarvis, who had
been slinking behind the others, as if he had changed
his mind about fighting, and desired only to get away,
made a quick move toward the door leading to the
other part of the house.</p>

<p>“Stop him!” shouted Milmarsh. “If once he gets
out of that door he’ll destroy the evidence.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by evidence?” asked Jack
Denby. “Do you think Jarvis is hiding cards about
him now?”</p>

<p>“I know he is,” was the hot reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bring him back, then!” cried Denby. “Let’s look!”</p>

<p>The two waiters and the three other players, including
Jack Denby, surrounded Jarvis, keeping a
wary eye on Howard Milmarsh, to see that he did not
take the cowering wretch by the throat.</p>

<p>“His left cuff!” cried Milmarsh. “Look inside!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” broke out Jack Denby.</p>

<p>He had thrust his fingers inside the stiff shirt cuff
of the accused man and brought out three cards. They
were the ace of hearts, the king of diamonds, and the
king of clubs.</p>

<p>He threw them upon the table, faces upward, with
a grunt of disgust.</p>

<p>“There you are, boys!” exclaimed Howard Milmarsh.
“He brought out the other ace, as I told you—and
I saw him do it. His idea was to ‘sweeten’ his
hand, of course. He meant to do the same thing with
these other cards you’ve just taken from him. He may
have others about him—in his pockets, down the back
of his neck, or anywhere. He seems to have the trick
of hiding cards down fine.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any other cards,” protested Richard
Jarvis.</p>

<p>“You had those,” Jack Denby reminded him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how they got caught in my cuff.”</p>

<p>A burst of laughter from Denby and the three other
men rang through the room.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how they got ‘caught,’ eh?”
sneered Denby. “Cards don’t often get ‘caught’ inside
a man’s shirt cuff without some help. I guess you’d
better give up all the money you have won to-night,
and we’ll divide it among the rest of us. I don’t know
which has lost the most, but it is quite sure that all
you have is not your own—as an honest man. Eh,
Milmarsh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what is done with the money he
cheated us out of,” returned Howard Milmarsh coldly.
“That is not of any importance to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is to me,” declared Denby, laughing. “I was
about broke. I should have had to drop out before the
next hand.”</p>

<p>“All right, Jack! You can have my share, and
welcome,” said Howard indifferently. “You have
earned it by holding that rascal back when he was going
to sneak away. What he has to answer to me for
are two things.”</p>

<p>“That so? What are they?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, he is a cheat—a blackleg—and
he insulted me by presuming to sit in a poker game
with me.”</p>

<p>“Well, he insulted us all in that respect, old man,”
observed Denby.</p>

<p>“In the next place, he applied a word to me that he
must answer for, and which can be done only in one
way,” continued Howard Milmarsh. “That way is
to stand up and take his thrashing. Or, if he prefers,
to take it lying down. It is immaterial to me.”</p>

<p>Milmarsh threw off his coat and continued to walk
toward Jarvis, who was hiding behind the two big
serving men.</p>

<p>“Come out of that, Jarvis! Stand aside there, you
two!” commanded Milmarsh, addressing the waiters.</p>

<p>The men shrugged their shoulders. They were supposed
to keep order if any persons unknown to the
management of the Old Pike Inn happened to intrude.
But these five young men were all members of wealthy
and prominent families, and were not to be treated like
mere brawlers, of no social standing.</p>

<p>Howard pushed past them, and they stepped out of
his way. They did not care much for Richard Jarvis,
anyhow.</p>

<p>When Jarvis saw that he could not avoid an encounter
with his cousin, he tried to pull himself together,
and made a show of putting up his hands.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so, when Milmarsh sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
crashing swing into his chest. The blow was intended
for the chin, but Jarvis, by quick defense, diverted it,
thus saving the vulnerable part of his person.</p>

<p>Jarvis knew something about boxing, and he retaliated
to Milmarsh’s onslaught with a glancing blow on
the forehead that made his cousin mad. The consequence
was a feint to the chest, which Jarvis blocked,
and then a tremendous jab at the chin that stretched
the latter across the floor, senseless.</p>

<p>“By George, Milmarsh! He’s dead!” cried one of
the other players, in startled tones, as he knelt by the
side of the prostrate Jarvis. “You gave him a tap that
settled him.”</p>

<p>The speaker was Budworth Clarke, a young doctor,
who had lately taken his diploma and hung out his
shingle, and he delivered himself with authority.</p>

<p>“It can’t be, Bud,” protested Milmarsh. “I only
landed an ordinary knock-out.”</p>

<p>“You thought you did,” was the reply. “But he
must have had a weak heart. Now, the thing for you
to do is to get a lawyer, quick. We may show that
it was an accident, but we can’t get over the fact that
he has passed out.”</p>

<p>Howard Milmarsh did not wait for the end of this
oration. He walked deliberately to the outer door of
the room, unlocked it with the key that had never
been removed from the keyhole, and went down the
two flights of stairs which led to the great reception
room.</p>

<p>The usual nightly “hop” was in progress. But Milmarsh
was in evening dress, and, though a close observer
might have noted his flushed face and guessed
the cause to be drink, he was able to pass around the
throng without particular regard from anybody.</p>

<p>“I’ll go right home,” he muttered. “It’s the only
thing I can do. Then I will see.”</p>

<p>It was just as he reached the outer door—where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
half a dozen automobiles were drawn up on the great
asphalt space where visitors to the Old Pike Inn could
park their machines when they did not care to have
them run into the garage—that he exchanged a cheerful
good evening with a handsome man, in evening
clothes, whose keen eyes followed him as he passed
out.</p>

<p>“Young Milmarsh!” observed this gentleman to
himself. “He’s been drinking again! Great pity! A
fine young fellow! And owner of more property than
any one in this part of the country. That is, he <em>will</em>
own it when his father dies. Well, I suppose he feels
that he must have his fling. But I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>The maker of these observations was a person
known the world over as a great detective. His
name was Nick Carter.</p>

<p>He watched Howard Milmarsh go to a handsome
car, in which the chauffeur was sitting half asleep,
and get in. The young man himself took the wheel.
Then, after one quick glance in the detective’s direction,
he drove hurriedly away up the winding road
that led to the great Milmarsh mansion on the hill.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="II">CHAPTER II.
<br />
<small>REMORSE.</small></h2>


<p>The great steel-manufacturing firm of Howard
Milmarsh &amp; Son, with its immense plant in western
Pennsylvania and its palatial offices in New York,
was not any better known in business circles than was
the palatial home of the head of the house among the
Westchester hills.</p>

<p>It had been the custom of Howard Milmarsh, the
elder, to entertain lavishly for years, his brilliant wife
being an acknowledged leader of society. Then, one
night, she took cold in her limousine, riding from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ball in New York to their home, dressed only in the
light ball gown, with a flimsy lace scarf over her bare
shoulders.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to go into the details of her illness.
Pneumonia is a swift disease. In ten days she was
dead, and a pall settled over the spacious and luxurious
mansion.</p>

<p>There was a large funeral, of course. That was the
last large gathering of the friends and acquaintances
of the Milmarshes the house saw. Her husband became
a broken man, physically and mentally. He had
an efficient and honest manager at the head of his
vast business interests, so that there was no lack of
money. But he seemed to lose all care for the world
after his wife passed away.</p>

<p>Howard Milmarsh, the younger—the personage
who struck down his cheating cousin, Richard Jarvis,
in the poker game at the Old Pike Inn—lived alone
with his father, and was the only comfort the elder
man had.</p>

<p>But young Howard was full of life and youth, and
it was natural for him to desire entertainment away
from the great, gloomy house.</p>

<p>Thus it was that he often spent days and nights in
the gay districts of New York City, and often drank
rather more than was good for him. He was not a
drunkard. In fact, most persons would have said
that he did not drink at all, measuring him by other
young men of his social position and wealth. Nevertheless,
he did give way occasionally—as he had done
on this night in the Inn—and there was always danger
that he might plunge deeper into dissipation if he were
left to himself.</p>

<p>“But never again!” he muttered, as he drove the
high-powered car up the winding hill, while the chauffeur
nodded beside him. “I’ve played my last card
and I’ve taken my last drink. I wish I’d made that
resolution before I went into that cardroom to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir!” interrupted the chauffeur drowsily.
“Did you tell me to take the wheel?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t speak.”</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t you, sir? I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“But we are nearly up to the house. You can take
hold now.”</p>

<p>They changed places. Then, when the machine was
again making its way up the road, Howard Milmarsh—who
had been trying to collect his thoughts in the
cool night air, and who had so far succeeded that he
had managed to throw off the effects of the liquor he
had consumed—directed the chauffeur to keep the
car in front of the entrance, under the porte-cochère,
while he went inside.</p>

<p>“I am going out again,” he added briefly, as the car
drew up at the doorway.</p>

<p>Howard hastened, first of all, to his own room,
where he found his valet, busy brushing some clothes.</p>

<p>“Fill two traveling bags with clothes and things
for a week, Simpkins,” he ordered briefly. “But first
help me into a business suit, with a soft hat. Give me
my automatic revolver, and that heavy hickory stick I
use for walking in the country.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” replied the imperturbable Simpkins.</p>

<p>In five minutes Howard Milmarsh had changed his
clothes, with the help of the valet, and, telling the
latter to place the bags in the car at the door, the young
man went to his father’s private room adjoining his
bedroom, and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Why, Howard, what’s the matter?” demanded the
millionaire, as his son entered hastily, before his
father could tell him to come in. “You look excited.
Haven’t been drinking, have you?”</p>

<p>“Not much. I’ve killed Richard Jarvis.”</p>

<p>The young man said this coolly, but it was the coolness
of desperation. His wild eyes and haggard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
cheeks told their own story. No further confirmation
of his startling confession was necessary.</p>

<p>Howard Milmarsh, the elder, was a slender man,
with a pale face and hollow cheeks. He arose from
the cushioned chair with difficulty, and, as he moved
toward his son, he swayed, as if he had not complete
command of his limbs.</p>

<p>“How was it?” he gasped at last.</p>

<p>“He cheated at cards.”</p>

<p>“Ah! That has been charged against him before.”</p>

<p>“And we fought.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I struck him a blow harder than I had intended.
It killed him. He had a weak heart, Budworth Clarke
said. But—father, he called me a liar.”</p>

<p>“I see. And you struck him.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He had been caught with aces up his sleeve,
inside his shirt cuff. That was the beginning of the
trouble. Then, when he was accused of what there
was actual proof of, he applied the word to me that I
could not take. I killed him!”</p>

<p>“Killed him!” echoed the older man vacantly, as he
sank back into his chair.</p>

<p>“So, now, father, I am going away. I cannot
stay here and face a trial for murder.”</p>

<p>“You would be acquitted,” his father put in quickly.
“The provocation was one you could not pass over.
Then, again, his death was an accident. If his heart
was weak——”</p>

<p>“I know, father. We can make all the excuses we
please, and, perhaps, they might convince a jury. But
the disgrace on our name would remain, and I should
still feel that I had become a murderer—even though
I did not mean it. So, good-bye, father! Good-bye! I
will let you hear from me when I can. I do not know
where I am going, and, if I did, I would not tell you,
so that you would not have to say what was not true
when you said to people that you did not know.”</p>

<p>The manufacturer went to a safe that stood at one
side of his room and took out a package of bank
notes. He handed them to his son.</p>

<p>“There are ten thousand dollars, Howard. When
you need more, let me know. And now, good-bye, my
son. I may never see you again. I am not well. But
come back soon, if you can. You will know what the
result of the inquiry into the death of Dick Jarvis is
if you watch the papers.”</p>

<p>“I may be where I cannot easily get New York
papers, father. I intend to go as far away from what
we call civilization as I can. I don’t know where.
But it doesn’t matter. There is one thing I want to
say in your presence, father, before I go away—one
vow I mean to make.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I will not raise my hand in anger against anybody
again. I don’t care what the provocation, I will
not fight.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can make such a resolution
as that, my son. Sometimes an occasion will arise
when you cannot avoid fighting.”</p>

<p>“I know that. But I will avoid it, even under
such conditions as those,” declared Howard resolutely.
“Don’t you see, father, that that will be my punishment
for what I did to-night to Dick Jarvis?”</p>

<p>The millionaire shook his head. It seemed to him
that his son was making a vow that he would find it
impossible to keep.</p>

<p>“I do not think you should hold yourself to such a
pledge as that,” he said. “Anyhow, I believe I shall
be able to smooth matters over for you so that you
can soon return home. I only have you, now that your
mother is gone, and I want you with me for the little
time I have to live.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, father,” returned Howard affectionately.
“You will be alive twenty years from now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Long before that I hope I shall have found a way to
come home and be a decent citizen, but I confess I
don’t see my way clear now. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>With a hearty clasp of his father’s hand, Howard
Milmarsh turned away and fairly ran from the room.</p>

<p>The head of the great steel firm—whom so many
thousands envied for his wealth, and presumably his
happiness—sank back in his deep chair, and let the
tears trickle slowly down his worn cheeks. The
widower felt as if his heart had been broken for the
second time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the son dashed down the wide staircase
and hurried into the waiting machine.</p>

<p>The traveling bags were already stowed away in the
back of the car, and Simpkins stood at the side of it,
overcoat and hat on, to go with his employer.</p>

<p>“I shan’t want you, Simpkins,” said Howard calmly.
“To-morrow morning go in and see my father. He
will make arrangements with you. I shall be away for
a week—perhaps much longer. I am going to New
York. Drive on, Gustave!” he added, to his chauffeur.
“Take the road straight into New York and stop at
the Hotel Supremacy. You know where that is.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Gustave briefly, as he threw on
the power.</p>

<p>The road Gustave took did not lead past the Old Pike
Inn. Howard Milmarsh had remembered that when he
gave the direction. He did not want to run right into
the arms of the law, and he did not forget that he had
seen Nick Carter watching him from the porch of the
popular resort.</p>

<p>It was not the habit of Carter to take up any ordinary
murder case, even when it came immediately
under his notice. But Howard Milmarsh had a feeling
that the great detective would surely concern himself
in this one, for he had long been a friend of Howard’s
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>While Howard Milmarsh skimmed along at thirty
miles an hour and more in the direction of New York,
Nick was hurrying up to the Milmarsh mansion in the
large, gray car that he generally used for his country
excursions, and which had brought him to the Old
Pike Inn that evening.</p>

<p>“Mr. Nick Carter would like to see you, sir,” announced
a wooden-visaged servant in livery to the millionaire,
not more than twenty minutes after the departure
of his son. “He will not detain you long,
he told me to say.”</p>

<p>“Show him in, of course!” ordered Milmarsh,
arousing himself and preparing to receive his caller
smilingly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Carter!” was his warm greeting. “I’m very
glad to see you. Did you just run up from New
York?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the grave reply. “I’ve been at the Old
Pike Inn most of the evening. I came up to speak to
you about your son Howard!”</p>

<p>The millionaire jumped forward and held up a hand
close to the detective’s face to silence him, while an
expression of agonized terror appeared on his haggard,
aristocratic face.</p>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<br />
<small>WHO KILLED JARVIS?</small></h2>


<p>“You know that Howard had a fight in the Inn to-night?”
asked Nick, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Yes. He has told me. But—but it was an accident.
He did not mean to do it. You know my son
too well to believe anything else.”</p>

<p>“I know he is hot-tempered, and that he had been
drinking to-night,” was the response. “But I want
to tell you——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no! Don’t tell me! I know all about——”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. My boy told me. What is the use of
repeating——”</p>

<p>The detective smiled protestingly, as he took the
millionaire’s wrist in his fist, to keep him quiet.</p>

<p>“Let me speak, Mr. Milmarsh. I came to tell you
that your son did <em>not</em> kill Richard Jarvis.”</p>

<p>“Not kill him? Are you sure of that? Is he alive?”</p>

<p>“He was alive for ten minutes after your son struck
him. In fact, he was as well as ever. The blow on
the chin was only one of the sleep-producing kind that
are dealt at many boxing matches. What they call a
‘knock-out.’ Jarvis had entirely recovered from that
almost before Howard was out of the Inn.”</p>

<p>“Then Dick Jarvis is alive?” asked Milmarsh
eagerly.</p>

<p>“<em>No, he is dead!</em>”</p>

<p>Howard Milmarsh fell back, his mouth dropping
open and a terrified light gathering in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But, as I have told you, your boy did not
kill him. You need have no fear about that. Where
is your son? I should like to tell him. I have no
doubt he is nearly out of his mind over the belief that
he has committed murder.”</p>

<p>“He is. But he is not at home. He has gone away—to
New York, I believe. I hope he will be back in
the morning. Tell me how it is that Richard Jarvis is
dead. I have had no communication with him or his
father since long before my wife died, but I am sorry
Richard is dead.”</p>

<p>“He was not really a cousin of your son’s, was he?”
asked Carter.</p>

<p>“No. His father was my wife’s half brother, so
that I never considered him a relative, in the true sense
of the word. And yet, if I had no son——”</p>

<p>“I know all about that,” interrupted the detective.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“Don’t think of it. You have a son, and a good
one, take him altogether. As for Richard Jarvis’
death, it is not easily explained. After your son left
the Inn, Thomas Jarvis, Richard’s father, appeared
there, in a rage, asking for his son.”</p>

<p>“They always quarrel a great deal, I believe,” remarked
the millionaire. “Richard’s drinking and
gambling is the cause of it, I’ve been told. They have
not any too much money, and it makes Thomas Jarvis
angry when Richard wastes any in dissipation. But
go on.”</p>

<p>“Thomas Jarvis forced his way upstairs, to the
poker room, and there was a hot dispute between
father and son. One of the waiters was the only other
person in the room. He says that, in the midst of the
fuss, Richard made a lunge at his father with his fist,
but, being stupid with drink—for he had a lot more
after the trouble with Howard—he stumbled over the
disordered rug and pitched headlong on an iron fender
in front of the open fireplace.”</p>

<p>“And it killed him?”</p>

<p>“Fractured the skull. I saw him. He was quite
dead. But—there was a peculiar little circumstance
that I have not said anything about, and shan’t, unless
the coroner brings it up.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“Some small fragments of glass were in the wound,
and a broken champagne bottle lay at his side. It may
have been that he fell upon the bits of glass, if the bottle
had been previously broken. But—if the coroner
is suspicious, he might make an exhaustive inquiry in
the hope of proving that the bottle had been used as a
weapon and that Thomas Jarvis had killed his son.
That is all I came to tell you,” added the detective. “I
hope your son will be home in the morning. If not,
he’ll come as soon as he learns the truth, anyhow. I
don’t know just what the papers will publish about it
to-morrow. I don’t think they will have anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective said this with a curious smile that
caused the millionaire to ask him why he thought so.</p>

<p>“There are ways of holding back news from even
the livest papers—if you know how to do it, and have
a little influence,” he admitted significantly.</p>

<p>“I wish you would stay and smoke a cigar with me,
Carter,” said the millionaire, as the detective got up
to go. “There is something I wanted to speak to you
about.”</p>

<p>Carter nodded and took the seat proffered by his
host. He accepted a cigar from the humidor at his elbow.
Then, as he lighted up and blew a ring of smoke
from his lips, he glanced inquiringly at the millionaire.</p>

<p>“It is only about my health, Carter,” explained
Milmarsh. “I don’t believe I shall live very long.
When I die, of course Howard will succeed me, and I
have little doubt he will take an active part in managing
the business. He won’t have to change the title of
the firm. It will continue to be Howard Milmarsh &amp;
Son. That is my desire, expressed in my will.”</p>

<p>“I know Howard wouldn’t want to change that,”
declared the detective. “Howard has considerable
respect for the name you both bear. But I don’t believe
you are going to die for many years.”</p>

<p>“I know better,” returned the other. “I know the
symptoms, unfortunately, too well. That is why I am
not smoking this evening. All I want to ask of you is
that you will see Howard gets his birthright.”</p>

<p>“You have made all proper, legal arrangements,
have you not? Your will is in a safe place, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is not it. One copy of my will is in my
safe-deposit box in my New York bank, and another
is in the possession of my attorneys, Johnson, Robertson
&amp; Judkins, of New York. What has always troubled
me is that Howard is a little wild, and that he
might do something which would give enemies an
opportunity to rob him of his inheritance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“How could anybody do that?” queried Nick, smoking
steadily. “Even if you had not made a will,
Howard is your only child, and he would succeed as
heir at law.”</p>

<p>“But, suppose he were not to claim his inheritance?
Suppose, for some reason, he could not be found?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the detective. “Don’t
you know where he is now? If he went to New York,
we could hear of him at the Hotel Supremacy, I have
no doubt. That is where he generally goes when he’s
in the city. Of course, he may have gone to one of
his clubs. But, even then, it would not be hard to
find him.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter smoked in silence for a full minute before
he spoke again. Then he asked, more earnestly
than he had spoken hitherto:</p>

<p>“Do you think Howard has gone farther than New
York—that he has sailed to some foreign country,
for instance?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where he is,” replied the millionaire.
“What I do know,” he continued slowly, and with his
breath coming fast between his words, “is that I am
not well to-night, and that a presentiment hangs over
me that I should have taken better care of my boy.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! You have nothing to reproach yourself
with in that respect. I can testify to that,” said Carter
encouragingly. “You have been excited over this unfortunate
affair at the Old Pike Inn, and it has got on
your nerves. Howard deserves to be spanked for upsetting
his father in this way. Let me give you a little
brandy.”</p>

<p>He went to the handsome mahogany cellaret at one
side of the room, and brought out a decanter of
brandy.</p>

<p>The detective had visited Howard Milmarsh many
times, and he knew just where to find anything that
might be wanted in this room. He poured out a little
of the liquor and gave it to the millionaire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks!” gasped Milmarsh. “That will do me
good. Now, Carter, will you promise me that in case
anything happens to me before Howard comes back,
you will see that he is not defrauded in any way?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I don’t see the necessity,” laughed
the detective. “But, of course, I will do it.”</p>

<p>“That is not all,” went on the millionaire, who
seemed to be stronger now than at any time since
Carter had been with him. “I have already taken legal
measures to give you the authority you might require.
The papers are in the hands of Johnson, Robertson &amp;
Judkins, all properly drawn up.”</p>

<p>“What papers?”</p>

<p>“Making you the legal guardian of my son until he
is in full possession of my estate. After that, he can
take care of himself.”</p>

<p>“Rather a queer—or, at least, an unusual—proceeding,”
remarked the detective.</p>

<p>“Possibly. But it will make Howard safer. Now,
I know you would do anything for Howard or his
father. We have been friends too long for me to
doubt that. But I like to do matters of business in a
businesslike way. Therefore I have provided that
you shall receive five per cent of the value of the whole
estate when Howard takes legal possession. Will that
be satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“Satisfactory?” repeated Nick. “Why, you are
rated at ten million dollars—perhaps more. Five per
cent of that would be——”</p>

<p>“Never mind about figuring it up,” interrupted
Howard Milmarsh, smiling wanly. “You will accept
the trust?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old friend! I felt sure you would. I hope
I shall hear something about my boy by the morning.”</p>

<p>“You shall if I can do anything to bring it about,”
said Nick, rising. “I am going to New York now, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I think I know about all the places in which Howard
is likely to take refuge in the great city of light.”</p>

<p>He went over to Milmarsh and shook hands. It
struck the detective that the millionaire’s hands had
never been quite so thin before, and that he had never
noted such a weary look in the hollow eyes. But he
made no comment, of course.</p>

<p>“Good night,” he called out from the door. “I’ll
telephone the house as soon as I find the boy. Good
night!”</p>

<p>“Good night!” was the response. “I’ll have some of
the servants take the message. I’m going to bed. I
feel that I need rest—a long rest!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter had not reached the bottom of the hill
leading from the Milmarsh mansion to the State road,
when he saw the lights of a car coming toward them,
and he knew it must be the car in which young Howard
had gone to New York.</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>As the detective gave this order to his chauffeur
and his big car came to a halt, the other car drew up
alongside and also stopped as the driver perceived
they were waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Milmarsh in New York?” asked
Carter imperatively.</p>

<p>“I put him down at the Hotel Supremacy,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Did he put up there?” asked Nick, as the other
driver pushed his lever forward, preparatory to going
on. “Don’t be in a hurry, please. You know me,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Carter!”</p>

<p>“Then you know you’d better answer me without
any quibbling. I asked whether Mr. Howard Milmarsh
went into the Hotel Supremacy, to stop there
for the night?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he did, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you think so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because he stood just inside the lobby after getting
out of the car, and wouldn’t let any of the porters take
his bags.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“As I turned my car around, I had a view of the
doorway, and I saw Mr. Milmarsh come out and get
into a taxi.”</p>

<p>“Where did the taxi go?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. I didn’t think of following it.
That would not have been any of my business. It vanished
among all the other taxis and motor cars in
the avenue. I shouldn’t have thought anything of it
at all if you hadn’t asked me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s true,” remarked Carter, half to
himself. Then, louder: “That will do. Good night!”</p>

<p>The detective called up every club, hotel, restaurant,
and private home in which it might be possible to hear
of Howard Milmarsh. But the same answer was returned
from all. Nobody had seen him that day or
evening. Even the Hotel Supremacy could give him
no information.</p>

<p>Nick Carter went to his comfortable home in New
York, and settled himself behind the great oaken table
he used in his library, as he lighted one of his own
particular perfectos, to think over the incidents of the
evening.</p>

<p>He was only half through his cigar when the telephone
bell rang. With his customary deliberation, he
picked up the instrument and responded, in his grave,
firm tones:</p>

<p>“Hello! This is Nick Carter speaking!”</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Howard Milmarsh’s residence, in
Westchester. Mr. Milmarsh died five minutes ago of
heart failure!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of the millionaire steel man’s valet.
The detective knew it at once.</p>

<p>“I will come there as soon as my car can bring me,”
he answered. “In less than an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>As he hung up the receiver, he pressed a button
that brought into the room his confidential assistant,
Chick Carter.</p>

<p>“Chick, Howard Milmarsh, the steel manufacturer,
is dead. While I am at the house—which will be all
night, and, perhaps longer, try to find the son, Howard
Milmarsh, junior. At least, he is not junior, now that
his father is gone. Young Milmarsh was in New
York to-night, and he has not gone home. Understand?”</p>

<p>“I understand,” replied Chick quietly.</p>

<h2 id="IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br />
<small>THE WHITE FEATHER.</small></h2>


<p>In one of the newer towns of the Canadian Northwest,
far enough away from the usual paths of travel
to give it an atmosphere of mystery, as well as romance,
there is—or was, for things have changed in
that town in the last few years—a hotel which made
a feature of its cabaret performances, and in summer
considered its gardens and the water frontage on a
really beautiful lake, its greatest attractions.</p>

<p>The place was known as the Savoy, and the hotel
part of it was rather better than is generally found in
the northern lumber regions.</p>

<p>It was on a summer night, when it was comfortable
to sit out of doors, that a vaudeville entertainment was
in progress on the lawn stage of the Savoy.</p>

<p>A monologue had just been delivered by a middle-aged
comedian, in evening clothes, who had been a
singer in bygone times, but, finding his voice gone, had
been wise enough to “frame up” a “talking turn.”</p>

<p>The audience liked him, calling him “good old Joe
Stokes,” many of the men inviting him to join them
in a glass of beer at their tables, when he came out
from the sacred precincts “back stage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a custom in many of the free-and-easy places
of amusement in the West and Northwest, in small
communities, and Joe Stokes accepted the invitations
in the good-natured spirit in which they were tendered.</p>

<p>There was a large gathering, including men from
the mines, from the lumber woods, and from the other
industries existing for twenty miles around, including
a sprinkling of workers on the railroad, with some
tourists, who were there because they wanted to be.</p>

<p>It was this latter class that offered a round of encouraging
handclaps to a delicate-looking young girl,
dressed simply in white, with a white ribbon in her
long, dark hair, who came slowly into view and faced
the footlights.</p>

<p>“What’s comin’ off?” growled a rough-looking man
near the stage. “Where did this kid blow in from?”</p>

<p>“Guess she belongs to a Sunday school, and got in
here by mistake,” guffawed another of the same type.
“Why didn’t old Joe Stokes give us an extra encore?
This girl turn is goin’ to be punk, an’ I know it.”</p>

<p>The girl was evidently frightened, as if not accustomed
to singing in public. She may not have heard
exactly what these men were saying. But she had
caught the note of unfriendliness, and she turned appealingly
to the quarter whence had come the applause
of the tourists.</p>

<p>There were, perhaps, a dozen men and women, who
belonged to the tourist party, sitting apart from most
of the other persons in the audience, and they gave
the young girl another round of handclapping, accompanied
by the rattling of glasses on the table.</p>

<p>The orchestra, consisting of two violins, a cornet,
and piano, half hidden in foliage disposed in front of
the stage, seemed to be uncertain what to play. The
leader, his violin in his left hand, reached over the
footlights and took a few sheets of music from the
girl.</p>

<p>“What do you think o’ that?” chuckled old Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Stokes. “She didn’t know enough to give her music
to the leader before she come on! She didn’t have no
rehearsal, neither. I should have seen her if she had,
and I never clapped my lamps on her before.”</p>

<p>There was a well-built young man, with a cap pulled
over his eyes, sitting by himself at a table near that
at which the two tough-looking citizens who had commented
on the girl sprawled.</p>

<p>The young man had on the high-laced boots commonly
worn in country places—East, as well as West—and
his sack coat looked as if he were not at all careful
of his clothes, for there were marks of clay, sand
and mud on them, as well as indications that he had
come in contact with the bark of trees, more or less
roughly.</p>

<p>Men who knew the type would say he was a “lumberjack.”</p>

<p>He kept his eyes on the girl, but not obtrusively. It
was evident that he was interested in her, but was
careful not to annoy her by letting her see that he was
looking in her direction.</p>

<p>During the time the musicians were arranging their
music on the stands, she stood there, a slim little slip
of a thing, trembling visibly, but determined to go
bravely through what she had to do.</p>

<p>“What do you s’pose she’s goin’ to spiel?” grunted
one of the roughs to his companion.</p>

<p>“Search me! ‘Nearer my God, to Thee!’ maybe.”</p>

<p>Both laughed coarsely. For a flash of a second,
the young fellow who looked like a lumberman, and
who had been regarding the girl on the stage, turned
his keen eyes on the two jeering men. Then he turned
his back on them, as if they were not worth steady
consideration.</p>

<p>The opening bars of the plaintive old Scottish song,
“Robin Adair,” were played by the orchestra. The
melody was familiar to them—as it is to most professional
musicians—and they played it well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thunder!” growled one of the toughs. “Is she
goin’ to give us a hymn? If she is, it will be ‘good
night’ for hers!”</p>

<p>There were noisy laughs from many in the audience,
for liquor had been flowing, and the men were not
themselves. At least, it is to be hoped so, for the
honor of that part of the Dominion.</p>

<p>The singer flushed, but she took up the song when
the prelude was finished, rendering it with a delicacy
and pathos that would have stirred even that rough
assemblage had it not been for the ridicule a few of
the hardest men saw fit to express.</p>

<p>Before she had finished the first verse there was a
storm of hisses and catcalls, and the girl’s voice was
drowned. One could see that she was still singing
by watching her lips, but it was impossible for her to
be heard through the growing din.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a big man, dressed much as was the young
man who had been observing the girl in silence, got
up and strode toward the stage. Here he turned and
faced the audience, six feet four inches of brawn and
muscle.</p>

<p>Many of those in the inclosure recognized him. He
was a foreman up in the lumber woods, and he could
strike a blow that would knock an ox senseless when
he had a good swing. His name was Mackenzie
Douglas.</p>

<p>“Stop that, will ye?” he roared.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he picked up one of the small tables
by its twisted wire leg and flourished it over his
head.</p>

<p>“Anither bit o’ noise, an’ I’ll be amang ye, splittin’
heads wi’ this wee bit o’ table! Ye all know me, an’
ye ken I’ll do what I say! This young leddy is singin’
a bonny Scottish song, an’ I want to hear it. Sing
oot, my lassie! Sing oot! I’ll e’en keep order for ye.”</p>

<p>Mackenzie Douglas had a sour look, and no one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
inclined at that moment to fly in his face. The young
man before mentioned smiled quietly.</p>

<p>The singer began her song again. Her voice was
nothing remarkable. It was not powerful, but it had
been trained, so that she sang true. Besides, the melody
was one that could not be listened to long without
being more or less affected by it.</p>

<p>This time she made an impression which assured her
the sympathy of the better element in her audience.
The old ballad, with its haunting air, went home to
many a calloused heart, and it might have been seen
that a tear sprang out upon a bronzed cheek here and
there.</p>

<p>But there was still a disturbing group near the
front, with the two ruffians who had started the fuss
before, ready to drive the girl from the stage if they
could. They were angry at Douglas’ interference, and
they felt that they must “call his bluff,” as one expressed
it, in a low tone, to the other.</p>

<p>As the girl finished, a storm of applause broke out,
but through the handclapping, thumping, and cheering
could be heard loud hisses. It has often been noticed
that even one sharp hiss in a large assemblage will be
heard through the most insistent applause.</p>

<p>The young man looked quickly in the direction of
the two roughs. Even as he did so, one of them picked
up the stub of a cigar from the table in front of him
and hurled it at the singer. It struck her white dress,
leaving a black mark.</p>

<p>She shrank back, terrified and wondering. It looked
as if she could not understand such an outrage.</p>

<p>There were shouts of anger and protest from a
dozen men. But it was Mackenzie Douglas who took
an active part in the row that broke out so fiercely.</p>

<p>In a flash, he was again at the front of the stage,
glaring about him.</p>

<p>“Who threw that?” he demanded, in a voice of thunder.
“Point him out to me! Whaur is the skulkin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
cur that would do a thing like that to a young lassie
who is too good to wipe her shoes on most of us? If
I don’t find the mon that done it, I’ll come forward
an’ lick a dozen of ye till I find the richt one!”</p>

<p>The bigger of the two men who had been making
the demonstration against the singer let out a loud,
defiant laugh.</p>

<p>“I done it, if you want to know!” he bellowed.
“Now, what are yer goin’ to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Dan Mosely, is it?” replied the Scot,
more angry than ever. “I might ha’ known it was
some one like you!”</p>

<p>That was all Mackenzie Douglas said just then.
The young fellow who had been watching took a hand.
He pushed aside half a dozen men who were in his
way, chairs and all, knocked over a table, and was
upon the fellow Douglas had called Dan Mosely with
both of his sinewy hands.</p>

<p>Taking Dan by the collar, he swung him out of his
chair and hurled him at full length upon the floor,
with a couple of chairs on top of him.</p>

<p>The uproar was terrific. Many men, who had held
back from the row at first, were only too anxious to
get into it, now that this quiet young fellow had blazed
the way.</p>

<p>But Dan Mosely wasn’t beaten yet. The knockdown
had sobered him to some degree, and he was blistering
with rage. Shoving the tables and chairs aside, he
managed to reach his feet.</p>

<p>“Where is that dub?” he roared. “Show him to
me!”</p>

<p>He aimed a tremendous blow at the young man’s
face. But a clever duck of the head prevented its
doing any harm.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob Gordon!” shouted Mackenzie Douglas
to the young man. “You’re there, are ye? Ye did a
gude thing in layin’ out this galoot.”</p>

<p>He seized Dan Mosely behind as he spoke, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fellow was trying to strike Bob Gordon down from
behind with a chair.</p>

<p>“No, ye don’t, Dan!” cried Douglas. “This is goin’
to be a fair stand-up fight. We’ll hae it by the rules.
Tak’ aff yer coats, both of ye, an’ let’s see who’s best
man. Ye hae twenty pounds the best of it, Dan, but
I’m thinkin’ Bob can lick ye in spite of it. Come on,
Bob!”</p>

<p>But, to the intense astonishment of Mackenzie
Douglas, as well as of everybody else who had been
watching the fracas, Bob Gordon turned away.</p>

<p>“I won’t fight him,” said Gordon, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What?” howled Douglas. “Why not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to fight!”</p>

<p>“But what for? This Dan Mosely tried to hit ye,
an’ you knocked him down just now. There was the
lassie, too. Ye’ll hae to fight for her sake.”</p>

<p>“I won’t fight,” replied Bob Gordon steadily.</p>

<p>For a few moments it seemed as if Mackenzie Douglas
could not comprehend. His mouth fell open, and
he stared at Bob Gordon as if he were some strange
animal, that he never had seen before.</p>

<p>Dan Mosely laughed raucously. His companion,
who had helped him in annoying the girl on the stage,
joined in his coarse mirth.</p>

<p>“He knows better than to tackle me!” snarled Dan
Mosely. “I’d break him in two in the first round.”</p>

<p>“Bob Gordon, lad, what does it mean?”</p>

<p>The big Scot appealed to Gordon almost piteously.
He could not make out why Gordon was backing
down. He had never come across a case of this kind
before, where a full-grown man, young and active,
backed out of a combat that it was his actual duty
to enter. It was too much for Douglas.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell yer what it means,” shouted Dan Mosely
derisively. “He’s afraid! That’s all there is to it.
He’s a cur, an’ he don’t dare to put up his hands agin’
me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Douglas looked searchingly at Gordon, and his great
hands twitched, as if he longed to get into battle himself.</p>

<p>“Is that so, Gordon? Do ye mean t’ tell me that
ye’re afraid?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Douglas,” returned the young man, after a
pause, during which it could be seen he was fighting
with himself. “I’m—<em>I’m afraid</em>!”</p>

<p>Mackenzie Douglas was silent for a second. Then,
after raising his hand on high, as if calling Heaven
to witness the awful disgrace, he pointed a long finger
at Bob Gordon, saying, in a tone of denunciation and
scorn:</p>

<p>“Hoot awa’! You—you—coward!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="V">CHAPTER V.
<br />
<small>A CONFESSION.</small></h2>


<p>It is hardly necessary to relate that Douglas took
the part Bob Gordon should have played, and gave the
burly Dan Mosely the trouncing of his life. That
followed, as a matter of course. The fellow had to
be punished for insulting the singer, and if Gordon
would not do the work, why, Mackenzie Douglas was
only too pleased to take on the job.</p>

<p>But Bob Gordon did not wait to see the battle.</p>

<p>“Coward!”</p>

<p>The hateful, ignominious word seemed to pursue
him, as, with bent head, he forced his way through
the crowd to escape from the garden. Once clear of
the lights and jeering faces, he strode rapidly to a
remote part of the extensive grounds that were all
part of the Savoy premises.</p>

<p>What should he do? He could not stay up in the
woods and work as a lumberman any longer. The
men would make life unbearable for him—unless he
were to fight a few of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I cannot do that!” he moaned. “I cannot do
that!”</p>

<p>It was as he uttered this lament in an incoherent
wail that was somehow like the cry of a wounded animal,
that a white figure came bounding toward him
among the trees.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Gordon!” she panted. “I had to come and
thank you for taking my part so nobly!”</p>

<p>“Nobly?” he echoed bitterly. “Don’t you know
that there was more of it after that, and that I was
anything but noble then?”</p>

<p>“I know,” she answered. “And I think you were
quite right. You’d done enough.”</p>

<p>“They call me a coward!”</p>

<p>“What of that?” demanded the girl, her eyes
sparkling in her anger as she thought of the attack on
Gordon. “You’re not a coward! You’ve given too
many proofs that you are just the reverse. Just because
you would not fight that big ruffian! Call you
a coward! Why, I saw his head towering far above
yours. He is a giant!”</p>

<p>Bob Gordon flushed. He knew that the girl’s excuse
for him was well meant. But it hardly soothed
him or helped to restore his self-respect.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that,” he assured her hastily. “I was not
afraid of him—not of him! I wish you would believe
that, Bessie, although I’m afraid no one else ever will.”</p>

<p>“What was it, then?”</p>

<p>“Just this: I once—in a fight—killed a man!”</p>

<p>She recoiled a little. It was an involuntary movement,
but Gordon saw it, and it caused him to continue
quickly:</p>

<p>“I never meant to do it, Heaven knows. But we’d
quarreled, and it came to a fight. I remember that.
But I swear I do not recall striking a blow hard enough
to kill him. It was on the point of the jaw, and he fell
senseless. But he should have recovered in a few seconds.
It was not a deadly blow, ordinarily. We had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
both been drinking. That—that is why I never touch
liquor now, Bessie.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you didn’t kill him,” she whispered. “Perhaps
he was not really dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was. A doctor was in the room—a friend
of mine. He examined him, and pronounced him quite
dead. Then I ran away.”</p>

<p>“And that is all you know about it?”</p>

<p>“I heard afterward that the coroner’s jury found
a verdict of ‘Accidental death.’”</p>

<p>“Then you have nothing to fear.”</p>

<p>“My own conscience. And, if I were to go back
home, there are persons who know that I killed
Richard Jarvis. My father is a wealthy, influential
man, and he may have hushed it up. But <em>I know</em>. So
does he.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you had any letters from your father, or
anybody at your home, since you left?”</p>

<p>“No. It was two years ago that I left, and nobody
knows where I am. I have been up in the back country
ever since, and I have changed my name, too. I
won’t tell you my real name. It would not do any
good. But you and I have been friends, and I don’t
want you to think I’m a coward. That’s why I’ve told
you my story.”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you do. When I knew that Richard Jarvis
was dead, I made a solemn vow never to fight
again, no matter what might be the circumstances. It
has been a hard vow to keep, but I’ve done it somehow.
I never had to be called a coward on account
of it until to-night, however. That is why I’m going
away.”</p>

<p>“I should advise you to go home,” she murmured.
“You say your father is wealthy. I always felt sure
that you were not the sort of man you have allowed
yourself to be regarded out here. You are not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
ordinary laborer. Your manners are those of a gentleman.
That shows in so many little ways.”</p>

<p>“I’m a murderer!”</p>

<p>“No, no. Don’t use such a word as that. It was not
murder—if it happened in a fair fight. Any of the
men about here would say you had a right to do it.”</p>

<p>“That may be. But it would not be looked at in
that way in my home near New York. I am convinced
that if I were to go back I should be arrested
and have to go through all the horrors of a trial for
murder. The end would be, very likely, the electric
chair in Sing Sing. My blood turns to water and my
heart to ice when I think of such a possibility. I am
a coward about that. I am not afraid of death, I believe—of
death itself. But to die in that way! The
shame of it!”</p>

<p>He shuddered and covered his face with his hands.
She touched him gently on the arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Mr. Gordon! You torment yourself needlessly.
Take my advice and go back home. I must
leave you now. My father is going on to play his
violin solo. He does a trick act, you know—plays the
violin in all sorts of curious ways. Uses only one
string, imitates cries of animals and birds, and so on.
He doesn’t like to do it, for he is an accomplished musician,
and he feels that he is degrading his art. But the
audience demands it, and he is such a master of his
instrument that he can do anything.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Bessie. I am going away from this
place. I hope I shall see you again. You and your
father travel about, and you’re quite likely to come to
some camp where I am. Good-bye! Remember me
to your father, Mr. Silvius.”</p>

<p>Before the girl could reply, Bob Gordon—or
Howard Milmarsh, which, of course, was his real
name—had dashed away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Bessie Silvius made her way slowly to the back of
the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until the girl and Bob Gordon had both
gone that a man came out from behind a large bush
where he had been crouching, listening to the conversation.
He was in evening dress, but his shirt front
was crumpled and bore stains from the bush, while his
whole suit looked as if it needed pressing.</p>

<p>The man was none other than the monologuist who
had been hailed by his noisy admirers as “old Joe
Stokes.”</p>

<p>He had taken himself off when the row started,
because he did not care to be in a battle if it could be
helped. Moreover, he had seen the girl following Bob
Gordon into the darkness, and he had curiosity to see
what there might be between them—if anything. Joe
Stokes had a sort of liking for Bessie Silvius himself.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t luck!” was Joe Stokes’ self-addressed
remark, as he found himself alone, and ventured
to stand up and stretch. “I’ve always had my
suspicions about that Bob Gordon. He never seemed
to me to be like the other lumbermen. I’ve lived in
cities too long, and mixed too much with classy people,
not to know a man who has been a gentleman, no matter
what kind of clothes he wears. And now this
turns out to be—I’ll get into the hotel. I’ll have to
work quickly if I’m going to make anything of all
this.”</p>

<p>It was easy for him to get to the hotel without being
seen by the audience in the garden. They were some
distance away from the house, and were at the back
of it, besides.</p>

<p>Joe Stokes went around to the front of the long,
rambling frame structure, and soon was in his own
small bedroom on the third-story.</p>

<p>Opening a shabby but strong trunk—it was the sort
of iron-bound thing, built to stand rough usage, which
is known as a “theatrical trunk”—he took out a
newspaper.</p>

<p>The paper was folded small, so that one particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
paragraph was turned outward. The paper was old
and dirty, bearing marks of much handling. It was
not easy to make out the print, but Stokes had read it
before, and he managed to read it without trouble:</p>

<p>“If this should meet the eye of H.M., late of Westchester
and New York, he is urgently requested to return
home. His father is dead, and he is the heir to
the estate.”</p>

<p>Joe Stokes sat on the side of his bed and considered:
“‘H.M.’ means ‘Howard Milmarsh,’ of course. It
must, for see how the description fits him. And
there is five thousand dollars reward for anybody who
finds the young man, or gives satisfactory proof of
his death. ‘Communications should be sent to Johnson,
Robertson &amp; Judkins, attorneys at law, Pine
Street, New York,’” he read, from the advertisement.
“Good!”</p>

<p>He considered for some minutes. Then he muttered
slowly:</p>

<p>“The worst of it is that I’m afraid to go to New
York. If the police were to know I was there, it
would be the Tombs for mine, and a trip up the river
for a few years afterward. I’ll have to think this
out.”</p>

<p>He lighted an old pipe, with strong tobacco, and
composed himself to study out the problem of getting
hold of the five thousand dollars without giving the
police a chance to get hold of himself.</p>

<h2 id="VI">CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<small>DOOR AND WINDOW.</small></h2>


<p>While Joe Stokes sat in his room and studied, two
other persons were in conference in the room immediately
below his own.</p>

<p>They also wanted to find H.M., although their main
purpose in coming to this small lumber village and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
summer resort was to look for a man wanted for a
series of crimes in and about New York City. His
name was said to be Andrew Lampton, although, considering
the number of aliases he used, there was a
strong possibility that it was not his real name.</p>

<p>“Harold Milmarsh is here, Chick,” said one of the
two persons, after making sure the door of the double-bedded
room was locked. “I did not see him to-night
about the hotel. But the landlord says he is probably
over at the garden looking at the show.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go over and get him?”</p>

<p>Nick Carter—for it was the celebrated detective
who was sitting in the room with his principal assistant—smiled
at the impetuosity of Chick.</p>

<p>“Not till I tell you, Chick. We must go cautiously
about this thing, or we may lose our man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why. We are only taking him back to
be a multimillionaire. He doesn’t know his father’s
dead, I guess, or he’d have been back before without
anybody coming after him.”</p>

<p>“What is the name of this village—or town, or
whatever it is?” asked Nick, abruptly changing the
subject.</p>

<p>“Maple. There are forty or fifty places named
‘Maple’ in Canada. You can safely bet on running
into one every few hundred miles. It’s like ‘Newark’
in the United States. Did you ever think how many
Newarks there are about the country?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that, Chick,” was the rather impatient
rejoinder. “This place is called Maple. That
is enough for me. My information was that Lampton
told somebody in Chicago that he might go to Maple.
It seems he heard that some girl he wanted was coming
here. She is a singer, and her father plays the
violin.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get their names?”</p>

<p>Nick glanced at his assistant with a tired smile.</p>

<p>“Their name is Silvius. The father is Roscoe Silvius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and his daughter is known as Bessie. I suppose
her full name is Elizabeth. But ‘Bessie’ will do for
our purpose. We’ll go down to the restaurant and
see if they will give us a cup of coffee and a sandwich.
Then we can stroll over to the garden, where
the vaudeville show is. That was a long, tiresome ride
on the stage, and I dare say you are as hungry as
I am.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know just how hungry you are,” returned
Chick. “But I know I am about starved. I could eat
the china handle off a door.”</p>

<p>The two detectives had, in fact, been in the Savoy
Hotel only half an hour. They had arrived on the stage
from the terminus of the little railroad that ran out of
Edmonton, in Alberta, in company with a party of
three tourists, and had passed as such themselves.
There was nothing distinctive about their appearance
to tell the world what their profession was.</p>

<p>They had come direct to the room to which they had
been assigned, and, having had a wash and brush up,
were ready for the meal that was always furnished
for the stage passengers in the evening.</p>

<p>Nick Carter opened the door to go downstairs, but
quickly stepped back. He left the door open wide
enough to enable him to peer through the crack, and
held up his hand to Chick to keep silent.</p>

<p>For about two minutes Carter stood still looking
out. The room behind him was dark, and so was the
hall. But there was light in the hallways below, and
it chanced to shine feebly on the face of a man who
was fumbling at a door lock about a dozen yards from
where the detective watched.</p>

<p>“It’s our man, Chick,” whispered the chief. “He’s
getting into that room with a picklock. We are sure
of him now, and I guess we’ll see what he’s after in
that room. We can take him back to New York to
answer to that counterfeiting charge, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
things against him. But I should like to know what
game he has here.”</p>

<p>“It was lucky that both Milmarsh and Lampton
came to this place. We can kill two birds with one
stone. It isn’t often things break as well as that.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t ‘break’ particularly,” whispered back
Nick. “I knew Lampton would be likely to be here,
and I had definite information before we left New
York that Howard Milmarsh was working as a lumberman
near Maple, in Alberta. It is all perfectly
simple.”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder you didn’t trust somebody else to
gather these men in,” remarked Chick. “You might
have saved all this time for yourself if you’d just let
me come. I could have handled the case, I know.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter did not answer this grumbling tirade.
He did not seem even to hear it. Now he darted out
of the doorway into the dark hall, with Chick close
behind him, and tried the door, the lock of which
Lampton had been working on with his bit of strong
wire.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to break it open, Chick. Too bad! I
was waiting for him to get the door open. Then I
intended to nail him before he could shut it again.
He was too quick for me. Lampton always was a
slick individual. He slipped through and banged it
shut all in an instant. It has a spring lock, you see,
like our own—only with a different kind of key, of
course.”</p>

<p>The detective was annoyed that he had allowed this
rascal to keep him back, even for an instant. He
pushed with all his strength at the door, resolved to
break it in at all hazards. He could easily explain
to the landlord who he was afterward, and a dollar or
two would repair the damage.</p>

<p>“Mighty strong door!” exclaimed Chick, as he
hurled himself against it by the side of his chief. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
ain’t going to give way in a hurry. But we’ll have to
smash it open if it takes all——”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, for inside the room there
arose the sound of two men engaged in a fierce struggle.</p>

<p>They could hear furniture falling over, and the
scuffling of feet, mingled with pantings, as if the
contestants were in fierce grips, and putting forth all
their strength.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Chick. “That sounds like Lampton’s
voice. I haven’t heard it for three years, but I’d swear
it’s he that’s growling to the other fellow to stand
back.”</p>

<p>“Push the door!” returned Nick. “Never mind
about talking. We can do that afterward. I want to
get into this room.”</p>

<p>For a minute or two longer the racket continued.
Then they heard the sound of a window sash being
wished up violently, followed by more banging and
scuffling.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried somebody inside.</p>

<p>“That’s Milmarsh!” exclaimed Carter involuntarily.
“It means that the other fellow has got away. Down
with this door!”</p>

<p>The detective had considered, for a moment, the
wisdom of rushing down the stairs and out to the
lawn, to pursue the person who had just jumped
through the window. But he decided that it would be
hard to find anybody in the darkness who had had so
long a start, and he redoubled his efforts to get the
door open.</p>

<p>“Shove, Chick!”</p>

<p>“I am shoving!”</p>

<p>“Harder!”</p>

<p>“Gosh! I’m doing all I can!” protested Chick.</p>

<p>The two moved back a few inches from the door,
and flung themselves back against it with all their
weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>This time it yielded. With a smash, it fell into the
room. Unfortunately, the two detectives went with
it, and it took them a little time to get up and find
out just where they were.</p>

<p>Just as they fell into the room they heard a loud
noise at the window, and then the sash, which had
been held up by one of the primitive catches often employed
in country places, broke loose and came down
with a slam, locking itself as it did so.</p>

<p>Nick Carter, notwithstanding that he was in such
a mix-up, realized what had happened at the window.
A man had just slipped through and dropped to the
lawn after the first one, and, in doing so, he had disengaged
the sash from the contrivance which held it
up.</p>

<p>What worried the detective more than anything else
was that he realized he had lost both the men he was
after—the crook, as well as the heir to the Milmarsh
millions and the big steel-manufacturing plant.</p>

<p>The catch of the window which held the sash down
was out of order. That is a common complaint with
window locks of all kinds. It had become jammed so
that it was impossible to open it in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>Nick took from his pocket the jackknife he always
carried—an implement which had a number of useful
little tools in the handle. With this he pried the window
open and looked out.</p>

<p>“See anything?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“No. I did not expect to do so, either. But we
won’t give up the chase just yet. They can’t get out
of Maple easily. We’ll have them both before morning.”</p>

<p>“This is Howard Milmarsh’s room, isn’t it, do you
think?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“No doubt about that,” was the chief’s quiet reply,
as he lighted the lamp he had found on a side table—luckily
not upset in the struggle which had taken
place. “By Jove! That fellow was going through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Howard’s trunk. Look! See how everything is tumbled
over!”</p>

<p>“And a lot of letters scattered about. What are
they?”</p>

<p>Nick glanced through three of the letters hurriedly,
one after another.</p>

<p>“From lumbermen and miners, addressed to different
places. Howard has traveled about considerably
in the past two years, poor fellow! The significance
of these letters is not in the letters themselves,
for they are not important. But the way they
are tossed about shows that Andrew Lampton knew
there were some papers in this trunk worth taking—or
he believed there were. I don’t like Lampton being
mixed up in Milmarsh’s affairs at all—that is, unless
we capture the blackguard. Then it won’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will capture him,” declared Chick, with
sublime confidence in the infallibility of his chief.
“We’ll have them both long before we are ready to go
to bed.”</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. They searched every part of
the grounds of the Savoy Hotel, and hunted all over
Maple. But not a vestige could they find either of
Andrew Lampton or Howard Milmarsh! They had
got clean away!</p>

<p>In the end, the chief and Chick had to leave Maple
without their men.</p>

<p>It was a mystery, but Nick only smiled when his
assistant said that to him.</p>

<p>Solving mysteries of this kind—and even much
harder ones—was the life amusement of Nick Carter.</p>

<h2 id="VII">CHAPTER VII.
<br />
<small>TRACED BACK.</small></h2>


<p>It was six weeks after the disappearance of Andrew
Lampton and Howard Milmarsh from Maple, following
their jumping through the window, and Nick
Carter was again in his own home in New York.</p>

<p>He sat in his usual place, at the back of the heavy
table in his library, looking through some papers.
Facing him were Chick, with Patsy Garvan, the latter
in a rough and ragged disguise.</p>

<p>Patsy had the ability to “make-up” for any age, from
fifteen to seventy or eighty. He had a youthful face,
with a roguish, turned-up nose, and bright eyes, so
that it was easy for him to be a young boy.</p>

<p>That was the character he had now, and he smiled
cheerfully as his chief gave him some instructions.</p>

<p>“This man. Andrew Lampton—who is passing by
the name of Joe Stokes, according to my information—is
the main worker in this counterfeiting affair. Is
that what you have heard, Patsy?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard somebody called ‘Joe’ in that house,”
replied young Garvan. “But I never saw the man
himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, that does not make any difference. After
all, I don’t want you to do anything more than be in
the house, to let Chick in when he comes. You are
sure nobody followed you when you came away this
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet on that,” replied Patsy. “I know Jersey
City like a book, and if there’s any one can shadow
me in that burg without my finding it out, I’d like to
see him. I know twenty ways of gettin’ out of Jersey
City without no one knowing which way I went.”</p>

<p>“The street is a quiet one, and it is rather away
from Montgomery and the other thoroughfares where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a newsboy might be expected to be trying to do business.”</p>

<p>“A newsboy who wants to sell papers doesn’t stay
on any particular street,” replied Patsy. “He follows
up his business, no matter where it may lead him.
That’s the kind of newsboy I am,” he added, with a
cheerful grin. “This Salisbury Street is long enough—and
ugly enough—for any kind of business.”</p>

<p>“It is No. 25 Salisbury Street. That’s the address,”
remarked Nick, referring to a memorandum on his
blotter. “All right! That will do. Get over there
and lie low. When Chick comes, be ready. And,
above all, be sure you’re not seen going in.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll go in like a shadow under a
door. I’ve been hiding there for five days without
anybody getting on. I am not going to fall down now,
just before the blow-off. Not much!”</p>

<p>With this earnest assurance, Patsy nodded to Chick,
waved his hand to the chief, and slipped away.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing we have Patsy to help,” remarked
Nick, when the door had closed. “This man Lampton
is a keen rascal, and if he had the least suspicion
we had traced him from Maple to New York, we
should not get him this time, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we should not get him at all,” ventured
Chick.</p>

<p>“Yes, we should get him some time. You ought
to know that. When we go after a man as determinedly
as we have for Andrew Lampton, his capture
is never more than a question of time—and perseverance.”</p>

<p>“I hope that will be true about Howard Milmarsh.”</p>

<p>“It will. Strange that we should have so much
trouble to find a man just to hand a fortune to him.
But this is a world of strange things. Anyhow, I
promised his father to see that he got his rights, and I
will go through with that, just as steadily as I will
keep after Andrew Lampton till I have him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“The secret-service men will help. That’s one
thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I wish they weren’t in it. I’d rather do
without the aid of the secret-service and the police,
too, if I could. But it can’t be avoided. There’s one
thing—the police over in Jersey City are a pretty
bright lot of men. But they’ve been looking for Lampton
some time, and they’ve never dropped on this
crib of his yet.”</p>

<p>“Which shows the smartness of Lampton and his
gang.”</p>

<p>“Well, criminals must be smart to some degree, or
they never could pull off any job. Lampton is a clever
fellow, because he can do so many widely different
things. He is quite a good vaudeville performer, even
though his singing voice is gone.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!” laughed Chick. “Joe Stokes! They
seemed to think a great deal of him at Maple. I won’t
go till it gets dark to-night. I suppose I may as well
get ready, however. I’ve got to look like a decent kind
of hobo, haven’t I? The sort of man who is willing to
work if he can get a job?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. You put it very neatly. But you
need not do it just yet. You are quite sure Lampton
is still in that house?”</p>

<p>“Quite. That is, unless he’s got out while Patsy
was here to-day. Patsy has been keeping as sharp
an eye on the crib as any one could, and he knew, before
he came away to-day, that Lampton had gone to
bed for a few hours. You only want this one man,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, he is the most important. But I want to
see the whole gang caught. I have no mercy for a
counterfeiter. It is a dirty, contemptible business,
because it generally makes people suffer who cannot
afford to lose money. The secret-service men will
look after them, however—when they learn where
they are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which will be thanks to Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“Not to me alone,” was Nick’s modest correction.
“I have two able assistants, and they have done as
much of this work as I have.”</p>

<p>“Strange the secret-service men did not find them,”
remarked Chick.</p>

<p>The detective laughed quietly, as he took a perfecto
from his drawer and clipped off the end.</p>

<p>“It was,” he admitted. “They would have found it
soon, no doubt. But Lieutenant Brockton certainly
opened his official eyes when I told him you and Patsy
had discovered the den. It’s a feather in the caps of
both of you.”</p>

<p>“I should like to have seen him.”</p>

<p>“Brockton wanted to make a raid right away. But
I persuaded him to wait,” went on Nick. “I know
what these raids are. There’s a forcible entry, generally
with the breaking down of an iron-lined door,
which attracts the attention of the whole neighborhood.
Then there’s a rush, and, as likely as not, the
very man you want most of all gets away. No raid
for mine.”</p>

<p>The detective had his cigar alight by this time, and
as he pulled at it steadily, to make sure it would draw
properly, he gathered up some of his memoranda and
stowed it away carefully in a secret recess under the
table.</p>

<p>“It’s true enough that raids don’t always work out
well,” agreed Chick thoughtfully. “We lost Bill the
Bum just that way. And he got away with about
twenty thousand dollars’ worth of jewelry, too.”</p>

<p>“He was drowned in that wreck off Sandy Hook,
though,” remarked Nick. “So it didn’t do him much
good. You remember that tramp steamer, the <em>Lovely
Maud</em>? It was in a collision with a tank steamer.
The <em>Lovely Maud</em> went down like a stone, and Bill
the Bum, with all his loot, went down with her. Talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
about raids, however, we may have to make one,
if our own plan doesn’t work out.”</p>

<p>“It will work out!” was Chick’s positive assertion.</p>

<p>“I hope so. Lieutenant Brockton and the chief of
police in Jersey City are willing to let me try, at all
events.”</p>

<p>“And the scheme is to decoy them out one by one,
and pinch them in detail? Isn’t that it?”</p>

<p>“No. That would be too long and doubtful a
process. I have promised Brockton that you will let
us quietly into the house.”</p>

<p>Chick started. He had not worked out the matter
along those lines. At least, he had not put it into
those words, and he was not sure that he could do
what was required. But he did not raise any objection.
He knew better than to do that when
his chief laid out a program.</p>

<p>“How am I to do it?” he asked calmly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. That’s your business,” was the
cool reply. “I shouldn’t wonder if you will find it
rather difficult. But it’s your business, as I have said—not
mine. I’ve promised in your name that you will
do it, so, of course, you have to manage it somehow
or other.”</p>

<p>“Somehow or other?” murmured Chick inaudibly.
“I wish I knew just how it’s to be done.”</p>

<p>“We shall be ready a little before midnight,” continued
his chief. “I shall expect a sign from you that
everything is clear for us.” He took out his watch
and looked at it thoughtfully. “I guess you’d better
get into your hobo outfit. By that time it will be
nearly dark, and you can get over to Jersey. By the
time you are walking off the ferry on the other side
of the river, it will be as black a night as you can
want. Get busy as soon as you are over there.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“And keep it in mind that, when once things begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to move, they have to keep on rapidly till we have
nabbed our man.”</p>

<p>Chick felt that he was being loaded with a heavy
job. But it was not his disposition to back down on
anything. He had the fighting disposition, and, besides,
it pleased him that his chief had so much confidence
in him.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it or bust!” he declared.</p>

<h2 id="VIII">CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<small>IN THE OLD HOUSE.</small></h2>


<p>Ten minutes’ skillful work in front of the mirror in
his bedroom was enough for Chick in which to transform
himself into the character he desired to assume.</p>

<p>He put on a shabby sack coat, a pair of overalls,
with holes in them here and there, showing old trousers
underneath, a cap that came far over his eyes.
Also, he wore shoes which were patched, but which
had no holes in them, and were more comfortable than
they looked. Chick was always particular to wear
shoes in which he could move easily.</p>

<p>He did not put anything on his face to change its
appearance. It was not necessary. The cap covered
so much of his visage that it would not be easy for
anybody to recognize him at a casual glance. Around
his neck a dark-colored silk handkerchief did away
with the need for a collar and necktie.</p>

<p>He took the subway to Jersey City. Then he
walked swiftly toward his destination, on the outskirts
of the city.</p>

<p>Salisbury Street is one of the darkest and most
unfrequented thoroughfares within sound of the trains
on the Erie. There are boarding houses and rooming
houses in Salisbury Street, as on most of the streets
and avenues in that neighborhood. Tall, gloomy, narrow-fronted
houses abound—houses built long before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the present generation, when ornamentation was not
so generally demanded in residential architecture.</p>

<p>Each of these edifices has a deep basement, far
underground, a vaultlike yard, reached by iron steps,
and the whole surrounded by a rusty iron fence, giving
the place a general resemblance to a wild beast’s
den.</p>

<p>Besides boarding and rooming, there are other
businesses carried on in Salisbury Street. A Chinese
laundry occupies one basement, and a cobbler another.
Also, there are tinsmiths, plumbers, a delicatessen
store of uninviting aspect, and other commercial callings
of a more or less poverty-stricken look.</p>

<p>At one time this part of Jersey City was a favorite
residence quarter for families who sought to be exclusive,
and, therefore, fashionable. But the street
has fallen from its high estate, as so many like it
have done in New York.</p>

<p>The house in which Chick was interested had a sign
on the doorpost, to the effect that it was an “Artistic
Agency,” whatever that might mean. There was nothing
to explain it, except the sign, for most of the windows,
from top to bottom, were concealed by green-slatted
sun blinds. One or two, where the slats were
broken away in places, revealed dingy, yellowed window
shades, pulled to the bottom of the sash.</p>

<p>It was a double house, with an alleyway down one
side. The building jammed against it on the other
side looked as if it had not been tenanted for years.</p>

<p>Chick slipped down the steep, iron steps into the
basement yard of the empty house. It was not his
first visit. That had been made several days previously.</p>

<p>Under the high flight of steps leading to the front
door was a door, hidden in gloom even in the daytime.
Now, at night, it was absolutely black.</p>

<p>Through the keyhole of this door Chick blew two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
peculiar notes, suggesting a cat courtship, only not so
loud as one generally hears during such meetings.</p>

<p>Hardly had the last of the second note ceased when
a bolt was noiselessly drawn back on the other side,
and the door opened a little way.</p>

<p>“How is it, Patsy?” whispered Chick.</p>

<p>“That you, Chick?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Still there?”</p>

<p>“You mean the guy who——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” interrupted Chick. “Never mind about
details. We know who we mean without mentioning
names.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t goin’ to mention names, Chick. Jumping
Christopher! Don’t you think I know my biz? He’s
here, all right. I made sure of that as soon as I got
back, and he couldn’t have got away unless he went
up a chimney or by aëroplane. You can bet he’s still
stowed away in the crib, like a worm in last year’s
hickory nut.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can take a walk around the block now,
Patsy. There is no reason why you should stay in
this moldy hole while I’m investigating. Go and
get a breath of fog down by the river. There’s lots
of it to-night. But be back in half an hour, in case I
hit on something that I can’t handle altogether by
myself. Besides, I may want you to telephone the
chief or something. Get me?”</p>

<p>“Sure I get you, but I don’t like it,” protested Patsy
Garvan. “Why can’t I stay here and lend a hand?”</p>

<p>“Because this part of the work can better be done
by one than two. You needn’t be afraid you won’t
get your share of the fun. We are going to have a
hot time to-night, or I miss my guess.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be here in less than half an hour—a great
deal less,” were Patsy’s last words, as he went soundlessly
up the steps, in obedience to the orders of his
superior officer. “Guess I’ll do a little picket work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
my own account,” he added to himself, when he
reached the foggy gloom of the street.</p>

<p>As soon as Chick was alone, he stood perfectly still
for a few moments, to get his bearings.</p>

<p>First, he closed and bolted the door. Then he
reached about in the darkness of the narrow hall until
he fumbled against the banister of a flight of stairs
leading to the upper part of the house.</p>

<p>“I should like to have a light,” he muttered. “But
it wouldn’t be safe. I could snap on my pocket flash
easily enough if I dared to do it. Ah! Here’s a door
open. This is the back parlor, looking over the yard.
Let’s see what chance there would be for the gang to
get away if we should decide to have a raid.”</p>

<p>He found the window so grimed that he could not
make anything through it, although the light of a street
electric lamp shone across several of the yards, including
that of the empty house into which he had
made his way.</p>

<p>He rubbed one of the panes with the cuff of his
coat, until he was able to see through it in a fashion.</p>

<p>The view he obtained—such as it was, through the
foggy darkness, with the pale illumination of the
high arc light—comprised that of four or five small
back yards, each divided from the other by a fairly
high board fence. At the back was a higher fence, extending
the whole length of the street, so far as he
could discern. On the other side of this rear fence
could be made out the black stems and branches of
some jagged old elms, whose vitality had been destroyed
by the sulphurous fumes from the railroad and
adjacent factories long ago.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he exclaimed in a low, threatening tone,
as he took a small blackjack from his coat pocket.
“Who’s that? What are you snooping about here
for? Want to bring the cops down on us?”</p>

<p>To his astonishment, the response of the person he
knew was in the room came in the shape of a chuckle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of decided amusement. This was followed by the
well-known tones of Patsy Garvan, in a whisper:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Chick. This is Patsy!”</p>

<p>“It is?” exclaimed Chick, angry, but careful not
to speak aloud. “And what the blazes are you doing
here? I told you to take a walk.”</p>

<p>“I know you did, and I’ve taken it. You didn’t
say how far I was to walk, and I don’t care for that
kind of exercise, anyway. Why, Chick,” he added,
in more serious accents, “I <em>couldn’t</em> stay out there
while you were nosin’ about in here, liable to get a
crack on your bean at any moment. I just <em>couldn’t</em>.
I s’pose you’re mad, but I had to do it.”</p>

<p>“Come here!”</p>

<p>Patsy shuffled over to the other side of the room,
where Chick’s voice sounded. He did not know what
he was going to get, but he expected it would be a
harsh rebuke. Instead, Chick felt for his hand and
gave it a hearty squeeze, as he whispered:</p>

<p>“Patsy, you’re the limit. But, as you’re here, keep
quiet, and do what I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything you tell me, unless you say I’m
to get out,” replied Patsy. “That’s where I’m liable
to disobey orders, if it gets me a licking.”</p>

<p>“Stay here on guard,” returned Chick quickly. “I’m
going to see whether those fellows in there suspect
we are around.”</p>

<p>“I’d bet a pumpkin to a peanut they don’t,” rejoined
Patsy confidently.</p>

<p>Without replying Chick opened a closet in a corner
of the room, near the window, and through which
shone enough of the glow of the street lamp to show
him where it was.</p>

<p>Going inside, after a final warning to Patsy to keep
his eyes open, he closed the door, to exclude even the
faint, murky glimmer from the window, and felt
against the wall at the back.</p>

<p>He had been told so clearly what he would find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
there, that he had his fingers on a certain wad of paper
on the wall almost at once.</p>

<p>This wad of paper was stuffed into a very small
hole in the wall—which, between the two houses, was
only lath and plaster on the outside, with the thickness
of a single brick between, before it again became
lath and plaster in the other house.</p>

<p>To make the peephole properly, Patsy had selected a
spot where the bricks joined, with rotting mortar between
them. The house was very old, and mortar
wears out in the course of years. He had used a long
file, as well as a knife, and had cut a hole between the
brick and the plastering on the other side, which,
while small, was still large enough to suit the purpose
of Chick.</p>

<p>“By Jupiter!” was Chick’s breathless ejaculation, as
he obtained a good focus on the interior of the other
room. “Here’s evidence—all we want!”</p>

<p>It was an interesting scene at which he gazed now.
A workmen’s bench was before him, with a powerful
lamp, shaded, so that it threw a very strong light
upon the workbench.</p>

<p>Two men were seated at it, working on polished
plates of copper that Chick recognized at a glance as
intended for the printing of bank notes. The workmen
were so absorbed in their work, that even if he
had made a slight noise—which he didn’t—when he
pulled out the plug of crumpled paper, they would not
have heard it.</p>

<p>These two busy engravers were not the only persons
in the room. There were other men in plain
view of Chick.</p>

<p>One was sorting and examining a large pile of bank
notes—counterfeits—holding each one against the
light, and scrutinizing it narrowly, before he would
pronounce it “safe.”</p>

<p>The fourth man—a burly fellow, who must have
weighed more than two hundred pounds—was working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a roller press at the farther side of the room.
Chick could not see the denomination of the bills, of
course, but he heard the big man growl that “these
centuries don’t look as good as some we’ve done.”</p>

<p>“Hundred-dollar bills, eh?” muttered Chick. “The
scoundrels!”</p>

<p>These four were all industriously working. If their
occupation had been legitimate, he might have admired
them for the way they kept everlastingly at it.</p>

<p>But there was another person, making the fifth,
in the place, who did not show even the doubtful virtue
of exerting himself like the others. He was the
personification of laziness and worthlessness, for he
was lolling in a rickety rocking-chair, and yawning as
if he were too tired to live.</p>

<p>Chick found himself wondering why some of the
others did not lift him out of the rocker and bestow
a good, swift kick where it would do the most good.</p>

<p>He was not at all a bad-looking fellow. His
features were clean cut and rather aristocratic, and
he seemed to be intelligent, so far as Chick
could judge. His clothes were of a fashionable cut,
and he wore them as if used to expensive raiment.
Certainly, there was nothing of the laborer. It would
have been difficult to imagine him laboring at anything—except,
perhaps, scheming.</p>

<p>“There you are, Mr. T. Burton Potter,” remarked
Chick, apostrophizing the elegant idler. “I guess
you’re not likely to do it, either, now that we have got
thus far on the case.”</p>

<p>He pushed the wad of paper back into the peephole,
and let himself out of the closet to the room where
Patsy was still on guard.</p>

<p>“Seen anybody, Patsy?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul. Have you?”</p>

<p>Chick chuckled softly, as he laid a hand on Patsy
to keep him quiet.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen several persons, Patsy. Among them is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the man the chief is so anxious to take, T. Burton
Potter.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why the chief is so bent on getting him,”
remarked Patsy as, with Chick, they tiptoed to the
door of the parlor, and stood for a moment in the dark
hall.</p>

<p>“He has a good reason, you may be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it, but it puzzles me, all the same.
This Potter is only the ‘shover’ for the gang. He can
put over phony money easier than any of the others,
because he has the front. But that doesn’t explain
why the chief should think he is of so much more
importance than any of the others. It looks as if there
must be something behind it that we don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Patsy snorted defiantly.</p>

<p>“The chief wants T. Burton Potter for other reasons
than because he is passing fake bills. That’s
what I think. And I believe down in your heart you
think so, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I do, I have sense enough to keep quiet
about it,” was Chick’s rejoinder. “And you’d better
do the same. When Nick Carter is working out a
case on his own plan and in accordance with theories
of his own, it isn’t for us, his assistants, to interfere
with him. When he is ready to spring his trap, we
shall know what his real purpose is. One thing we do
know, and that is that we are to make sure the trap
holds T. Burton Potter when it is sprung.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll do that, all right,” returned Patsy confidently.</p>

<br />
<small>THROUGH THE CELLARS.</small></h2>


<p>“We’ll go to the basement, Patsy. There are some
points I want to clear up before going any further
with this case. Keep close behind me, now that you
insist on being here, and don’t do anything unless I
tell you.”</p>

<p>“All right!”</p>

<p>“I mean what I say,” whispered Chick, more
sternly. “I don’t quite like the way you said ‘all
right.’ It seemed to me you were treating my orders
rather lightly.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t,” denied Patsy in a hurt tone. “I
always do as I’m told, don’t I? And when you’re in
charge of a case, I regard you as the chief’s representative,
and I take as much notice of what you say
as if you were Nick Carter himself.”</p>

<p>“These two houses are exactly alike, from what I
can see,” mused Chick aloud, as they slowly descended
to the basement again. “What do you know about it,
Patsy?”</p>

<p>“I’d bet on it,” was the curt response.</p>

<p>“That’s what I think. We’ll go lower this time.”</p>

<p>“In the cellar?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The cellar stairs are under these, and the
door is not locked. Be careful you don’t stumble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look out,” returned Patsy. “I don’t want to
break my neck by going down headfirst.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that. But you might make a noise that
would attract attention—that’s all.”</p>

<p>Patsy shrugged his shoulders at this remark. But
it was too dark for Chick to see the gesture. Nor did
he hear the whispered observation of his companion.</p>

<p>“What does my neck matter, so long as we don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
spoil the case? That is a businesslike way to look
at it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Once in the spacious cellar, with the door above
closed, Chick announced that it would be safe to use a
light.</p>

<p>“Bring out your electric flash, Patsy, and I’ll use
mine. That’s right. We’ll take a general observation
down here. There are three or four cellars opening
out of each other. We’ll go over into that one next
to the other house.”</p>

<p>Many empty bottles and some wooden boxes that
had held bottles of beer were scattered about.</p>

<p>“Help me pile some boxes over in this corner against
the wall, Patsy. I want to stand on them.”</p>

<p>The work was soon done. Then Chick told Patsy
to turn out his light and stand still, keeping his ears
open the while.</p>

<p>The roof of the cellar was formed by the floor above,
and the heavy joists, crossing from side to side, rested
upon its walls. This left spaces between each pair of
joists at the top of the wall.</p>

<p>“If I’m not entirely mistaken,” thought Chick, “I’ll
be able to see something through those spaces.”</p>

<p>Standing on top of the piled-up wooden cases, he
peered through the opening. All was blackness on the
other side, and he decided that it would be safe to
use his electric flash.</p>

<p>The white glow of his flash showed him that there
was another cellar on the opposite side of the wall,
very much like the one which Patsy and he were in.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get through there, Patsy,” he announced,
as he came down to the floor. “But it’s going
to be tough. I couldn’t squeeze through that hole, nor
come anywhere near it.”</p>

<p>“What are you goin’ to do, then?”</p>

<p>“Make it larger. I came prepared for something of
this kind. I have a few tools belonging to ‘Fisher
the Engineer,’ who is rusticating at Sing Sing or Auburn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
at the present time. He was an expert burglar,
and he had the neatest outfit of tools I ever saw. The
police gave them to the chief, at his request, and I
have some of them in my pocket.”</p>

<p>Chick produced a three-jointed crowbar of fine
steel, and then brought out a shorter one, in two pieces,
which he fitted together and handed to Patsy.</p>

<p>“Pull out those bricks at the top, Patsy. We’ll
tackle one at a time simultaneously, and our combined
strength, with the leverage we shall get with these
‘jimmies,’ ought to make it easy.”</p>

<p>Chick’s prediction was sound. It took ten minutes
of hard, rather dirty work. But the young men had
tackled hard work before in the course of their profession,
and it did not trouble them.</p>

<p>When, at last, they had bricks enough out to make
room for Chick to get through, they chuckled softly
in unison.</p>

<p>“I’ll go first, Patsy. If I can make it, there is sure
to be room enough for you. Here goes!”</p>

<p>From the top of the boxes Chick crawled through,
feet first. He had to go that way, or he would have
tumbled in on his head, which would have been uncomfortable,
and, perhaps, dangerous.</p>

<p>“All right, Patsy!” he called softly, when he had
disappeared through the hole. “Now you come.
Don’t be afraid. I’ll catch you as you come in. It will
be easier for you than it was for me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! What are you givin’ us, Chick?” rejoined
Patsy disgustedly. “Am I ever scared at anything?”</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan had a right to say this, for a more
fearless young American it would be hard to find
in a day’s march. He did not realize, at the moment,
that Chick was only “kidding” him.</p>

<p>Chick eased him to the floor and chuckled.</p>

<p>“What are you laughing about, Chick?”</p>

<p>“At you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, what have I done that’s funny?” demanded
Patsy.</p>

<p>“Getting mad because I told you not to be afraid.”</p>

<p>“Well, how would you like to have anybody hand
a thing like that to you? If a strange guy passed me
such a crack, I’d push in his face,” grunted the disgusted
Patsy.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” laughed Chick. “And I know
that is just what you would do. But I was only
joking. You ought to have known that. Give me
your hand.”</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan laughed softly, and, turning on his
electric flash, so that he could see what they were
doing, he gave his hand to Chick, and they shook with
the heartiness of comrades who knew they always
could depend on each other, no matter what happened.</p>

<p>“What’s the move now, Chick?”</p>

<p>“We have to get a little closer to the gang. This
is going to be the <em>real</em> part of the work.”</p>

<p>“A scrap?” whispered Patsy hopefully.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>“Good! Fists—or guns?”</p>

<p>“No guns!” replied Chick quickly. “We don’t want
noise. Use your fists if it comes to a show-down.
Or any weapon you can get hold of that doesn’t
make a racket? Get me?”</p>

<p>Patsy only chuckled. It was not necessary for him
to say in words that he understood.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="X">CHAPTER X.
<br />
<small>INVESTIGATION.</small></h2>


<p>Hastening up a flight of steps that were a replica
of the steps in the cellar of the empty house, Chick
found that the door at the top was securely fastened.</p>

<p>“Just what I expected,” he muttered. “But I guess
I can get it open. There’s only a wooden button on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
other side. I might break the door right through,
but it would make too much noise. My knife will fix
it.”</p>

<p>One of the blades of his jackknife was long and
thin. He thrust this between the door and the jamb,
and pushed the button out of the way.</p>

<p>“Ridiculously easy!” he said to himself. Then, to
Patsy: “We have to get at the outer doors, you know—the
one into the kitchen regions, as well as the other
on the main floor. The worst of it is that they are
on the other side of the house. We’ll have to make our
way there. Or, rather, I shall.”</p>

<p>“What about me?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are, in the dark. It will be better
to have you ready in case I need help, than to let you
get into the muss with me. Don’t you see that?”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’re right,” grumbled Patsy. “But I
don’t like this waitin’ game. Maybe I won’t get into
it at all. Things are always breakin’ wrong for me.
Just when I’m all primed up for a rough-house, I’m put
on guard duty, like a boy at a henroost. Holy Perkins!
It’s tough!”</p>

<p>Chick did not stop to argue with his companion.
It was clear that if Nick Carter and three or four
policemen were to get into the house, they could not
take the time to dribble through the opening in the
cellar wall by which Chick and Patsy had made their
way from one cellar to the other.</p>

<p>When they came up the steps from the cellar, they
were on the basement floor, level with the bottom of
the courtyard in front of the house, and below what
was known as the parlor floor, with its main hall
leading to the principal door to the street, at the top
of the stone steps outside.</p>

<p>Passing along the stone-floored hallway, after making
sure that Patsy was out of sight at the door by
which they had come up from the cellar, Chick found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a door closed, but under which could be seen a line of
dusky red light.</p>

<p>He realized that he was coming near to the heart
of the mystery he and Nick had set out to solve.</p>

<p>Feeling for the latch, he discovered, with a thrill
of satisfaction, that it was not fastened. He lifted it
without difficulty and also absolutely without sound.
Then he took a peep through the crack he had made
when he pushed the door a little way open.</p>

<p>At first, he hesitated to open the door even wide
enough to permit him to peep in. He remembered the
five men he had seen in the other room on the floor
above, and it would not have surprised him to find as
many working down here in the cellar.</p>

<p>But the room was empty, although evidence that
somebody was close at hand was not wanting.</p>

<p>It was a large apartment, that looked in a general
way like a kitchen. Only, there was no kitchen range,
nor pots, pans, or dishes—at least, no utensils such as
are generally employed in an ordinary dwelling house
in the culinary quarters.</p>

<p>A large pine table was the only piece of furniture.
There was not even a chair to be seen.</p>

<p>On the table was an electric battery, an iron ladle,
a few tools, and some slabs of white plaster of oblong
form.</p>

<p>Over the table glimmered a gas jet turned too
low to yield any light. The red glow that Chick had
seen under the door came from a large, square stove
of peculiar make, which stood out a little way from
the wall opposite the door by which he had entered.</p>

<p>“That stove was never made for honest use,”
thought Chick. “You could not even cook an egg on
that thing. And I’m betting with myself that I know
just what that stove is doing in this place. It’s cooking
new money, or I’m a long way off in my guess.”</p>

<p>There were two other doors in the room. One of
them, he judged, led into the house, while the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
probably connected with the stone hallway ending at
the outer door to the front yard.</p>

<p>“I hear boiling metal hissing on that stove,” he muttered.
“The work is going on, all right. Why, yes!
I see the crucible sunk into the stove. I <em>knew</em> that
stove was built for only one kind of use.”</p>

<p>He went over to the door he believed led to the
other part of the house, and found it locked, but the
key in the door.</p>

<p>“That’s lucky! I didn’t want to have to stop to
break it open. Besides, it would have made a big
noise, and I don’t know how many men may be close
by.”</p>

<p>Once outside the door, which he closed softly as soon
as he was through, he switched on his electric light.
What he found was what he had expected. In one
direction were the stairs leading upward to the “parlor
floor,” and in the other was the outer door to the
front yard. Farther along the wall he saw the door
into the room he had just left, so that it was possible
to get to the yard by both exits.</p>

<p>“Now for the yard door,” he said to himself inaudibly.
“It’s locked, no doubt.”</p>

<p>He was right about this. The door—a very heavy
one, evidently built to resist possible attack—was
locked, and there was a heavy, rusty bolt pushed into
a massive socket.</p>

<p>Chick could have picked the lock and withdrawn the
bolt. That would not have been a long or difficult
operation. But he had had experiences of this kind
before. Therefore, he took another course.</p>

<p>“That rusty bolt would screech like a jackass in
agony,” he murmured. “I could never get it out of the
socket without proclaiming to the whole street what I
was doing. I’ll take the liberty of using some others
of the ‘Engineer’s’ tools. I’m glad he is in the den, or
he might be doing something with them, instead of
my making honest use of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Chick grinned at his own conceit, as he took out
a mechanical, automatic screw driver from the canvas
bag in which he kept the implements, each in its own
little pocket. With this screw driver he rapidly took
out the screws that held the massive socket of the bolt.
Then he removed the ponderous box of the lock in the
same way.</p>

<p>Chick was a good mechanic. He would not have
suited Nick Carter otherwise. So he did his work
not only swiftly, but noiselessly, and in a workmanlike
manner. A regular locksmith could not have done
it better.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to get back to Patsy, and send him out to
telephone,” he said to himself, when he was satisfied
that the outer door to the yard was not held by anything
save the swelling wood, which kept it jammed
against the doorpost, but not too firmly to be dislodged
with one good push. “Let’s see! The chief
told me just as I was coming out that he would be at
police headquarters in Jersey City. I wonder whether
I’d better telephone, or whether it wouldn’t be safer to
let Patsy go there.”</p>

<p>He might have asked this of Patsy, only that he
preferred to make up his mind from circumstances,
rather than on the advice of anybody—even so shrewd
a young fellow as Patsy Garvan.</p>

<p>When he had made his way back across the room
where the metal still simmered on the funny-looking
stove, and was at the door where he had left Patsy, he
had determined on what should be done.</p>

<p>“Patsy!”</p>

<p>“That’s me!”</p>

<p>“Anything happened?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. As peaceful as West Point on a
summer afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Well, get out and see the chief.”</p>

<p>“<em>See</em> him? I thought I was to telephone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought so, too, until I had time to think it over.”</p>

<p>“New York?”</p>

<p>“<em>No!</em>” growled Chick irritably. “And don’t pretend
to be a bonehead, Patsy, because I know better.
I’m talking about the Jersey City headquarters. Get
to the chief, and tell him he can come right in by the
door in the yard at the front of the house. Understand?”</p>

<p>“When you say ‘chief,’ you don’t mean the chief of
police of Jersey City, do you?”</p>

<p>Patsy did not wait for a reply. He just flung this
question at Chick to make him mad. Then he hustled
away to deliver his message to Nick Carter, who was
always <em>the</em> chief to himself and Chick.</p>

<p>Patsy had to squeeze through the hole in the cellar
wall, but that was easy.</p>

<p>“When I get time, I’ll take Patsy to Central Park
and dump him headfirst into the lake at a Hundred
and Tenth Street,” muttered Chick. “He’s aching
for excitement, and he needs cooling off.”</p>

<p>Chick decided that it might take twenty minutes for
Patsy to reach headquarters and bring Nick and the
police back. In the meantime, he might as well rest
a little.</p>

<p>First he went into the back parlor and took another
look through the peephole in the closet at the workmen
in the other room. There was no change in the scene.
The engravers and others were still busy, while T.
Burton Potter continued to loll in the rocker, as if he
had not a care in the world.</p>

<p>“A change will come o’er the spirit of his dream
before he goes to bed,” was Chick’s inward remark,
with a slow smile. “He may as well be as comfortable
as he can while the wind blows his way. Lord!
He is a lazy-looking loafer! Well, I’ll get to the other
house, through that infernal cellar hole.”</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that there would be an exciting
time for Chick in the course of half an hour or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
so—or, perhaps, because of it—he was quite able to
compose himself for a nap without allowing future
business to worry him.</p>

<p>He went up the stairs to a back room, where Patsy
Garvan had rigged up a sort of couch for himself
while on watch in the house the night before. It was
composed of an empty box and some burlap. Anybody
who happened to be fastidious might have found it
unsatisfactory. But it suited Chick. He was glad to
have anything big enough for him to lie down on.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing about this profession of ours,”
he soliloquized, “that you don’t find in every kind of
work. That is, its variety, as well as its excitement.
A fellow never gets dull or lonesome. If he did, I
don’t think he would be any good as a detective.”</p>

<p>Chick looked at the dirty windows, through which
glimmered the faintest reflection from the street arc
light already referred to, and was wondering, in a
dreamy sort of way, how many feet it would be from
the window to the ground, in case it should become
advisable or necessary for him to jump out, when he
sprang to his feet abruptly, and relieved himself of the
two words, “Blithering idiot!”</p>

<p>As no one was in the room but himself, it might
have been a matter of speculation as to whom he referred,
if he had not proceeded rapidly to make it
clear.</p>

<p>“I am an ass—with long ears! I left that door open—the
one leading from the kitchen to the stone hall
and front yard door. I know I did. It was shut and
locked, with the key in the door. Why in thunder
didn’t I lock it when I came through? I guess I must
have been in too much of a hurry. If any one goes
into that room and sees the door, the beans will all be
spilled, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>The detective knew it would not be long before
somebody would be in the kitchen, to look at the crucible.
The door would be found open—and then—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>—
Well, he did not stop to think about what would probably
happen in that case. He hustled out of the room
and down the stairs.</p>

<p>It was quite a trip back to the kitchen. He had to
go to the sub-basement, to the cellar, and squeeze
through the hole where the bricks had been taken
out. Then he would have to climb stairs and make
his way through doors, and at every step he might
meet from one to six men, who would kill him with as
little compunction as they would smash a mosquito.</p>

<p>“Fine prospect!” muttered Chick. “But—it’s all in
the game!”</p>

<p>He gained the kitchen without interference. The
molten metal still simmered on the stove. Everything
was just as he had seen it on his previous visit. Best
of all, nobody was in the place. The person, whoever
he might be in charge of the metal, was still attending
to matters elsewhere.</p>

<p>“The confounded door over there is still open,”
continued Chick to himself. “Just as I left it. Well,
I’ll soon fix that.”</p>

<p>He hastened across the room, closed and locked the
door, leaving the key in the door, as before.</p>

<p>“Don’t know how I came to do that! It isn’t like
me to forget a door when I’m in a place full of crooks.
I shouldn’t like the chief to know I’d done it. He’d
think I’m going dippy. Well, it’s all right now.
That’s a great comfort.”</p>

<p>He was halfway across the room to the door by
which he had entered, when the latch clicked, and he
saw it jump up, indicating that somebody was pressing
it down on the other side.</p>

<p>“Trapped!” muttered Chick. “Cut off, by Jupiter!
Now what am I to do?”</p>

<h2 id="XI">CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<small>THE RAID.</small></h2>


<p>Chick was thinking at electric speed as he hesitated
for a second in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>He was in a bad fix, and he knew it. Only, it was
not his habit to cry over spilled milk. What he
wanted to do was to hit on some method of meeting
the crisis.</p>

<p>If he could have got down to the front yard of the
house he was in, he would have done that. But there
was no time for him to unlock and open the door he
had just secured. He would be caught before he could
pass through.</p>

<p>Even if there were any possibility of his escaping
from the room in that way, the stranger, who was already
opening the other door, would see that it was
still open, for Chick certainly would not have time to
close it.</p>

<p>This may seem a great deal for Chick to think in the
instant required for a person to open a door after
pushing down the latch. But a whole lifetime has been
reviewed in a fraction of a minute, and Chick’s brain
was working like a dynamo in this moment of deadly
danger.</p>

<p>He must do something, and quickly. He did.</p>

<p>At the very moment that the door opened, he sprang
to the stove and crouched down between it and the
wall. He had noticed, from the first, that a space of
a few feet had been left there, so that the heat of the
stove would not set fire to the wall.</p>

<p>This was the one possible place of concealment in
the gaunt, bare room, and it was not much of a one,
at that. And it was hot—cruelly hot!</p>

<p>Squeezing himself into as small a space as he could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
he peeped cautiously around the edge of the stove
from the deep shadow that helped to conceal him.</p>

<p>“Holy mackerel!” he muttered. “This is a bright
prospect. That man looks as if he were here for all
night!”</p>

<p>It was the gigantic fellow he had seen working at
the roller press in the room overhead. He seemed to
have no fear of anybody being present besides himself,
as he crossed the room to the table, and turned up the
gas.</p>

<p>“What’s he going to do?” thought Chick. “Just
as I supposed. He’s settling down for a long stay.
And I’m roasting at the back of this stove. Great
Scott! I feel as if I were done to a turn already. He’ll
get the smell of me cooking before long. I can smell
myself.”</p>

<p>The big man had taken up one of the plaster molds
and was trimming it off with a knife. He worked as
composedly as anybody might who was following a
perfectly legitimate trade.</p>

<p>“Whew!” burst from Chick’s lips.</p>

<p>It was only an expression of pain and discomfort,
and it was not loud; this was fortunate, for the big
man started as if he believed he heard something, but
was not quite sure.</p>

<p>He stared about the room for a moment, during
which period Chick huddled back into the heat of the
recess behind the stove and prepared himself for a
fight, but seemed satisfied that he had not heard anything
except in his fancy.</p>

<p>“All kinds of funny noises can be heard in the night
in an old house like this,” he remarked aloud, as he
resumed his work. “I’ll be glad when this night’s
work is over, all the same. I’m pretty nearly all in.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” thought Chick. “I don’t believe I can
stand this another half minute. I’m almost touching
the hot stove, and the heat is something fierce. I
hope the chief will understand that I’ve had a tough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
time of it. A fellow likes to get credit for an experience
like this.”</p>

<p>His clothing began to scorch, the flesh of his face
and hands felt seared, in spite of all his efforts to protect
them, and in addition to this torture, was the sickening
effect of the poisonous fumes which were given
off at every crevice of the stove.</p>

<p>“I’m about all in,” murmured Chick, as he tried to
find a position a little farther away from the stove,
without betraying himself. “I can begin to understand
how people have felt who were burned at the
stake. Hello! Here comes that big lummox to put
on more heat.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the big man was approaching, but it was
apparent that he had no suspicion of anybody else being
in the room. He whistled softly as he came forward.</p>

<p>After tending the fire—for which Chick inwardly
cursed him—he stirred the pot of metal with a steel
rod. By this time Chick was compelled to crouch
closer to the awful stove, to keep out of view of the
big man.</p>

<p>“Good thing there is a black shadow back here,”
thought Chick. “But for that he must have seen me.”</p>

<p>The fellow went back to his table and resumed work
there. His manner was that of one who had a long
night’s work ahead of him, and Chick had difficulty in
repressing a loud groan.</p>

<p>“If the chief and the police would come!” he
prayed. “That’s about my only hope!”</p>

<p>He listened eagerly to catch the slightest sound
from the hall leading to the stairs to the cellar. If he
could have heard anything, he would have felt pretty
sure that the raiding party had arrived.</p>

<p>Suddenly he believed he could make out the shuffling
of feet in the hall. He was not sure, but he thought
the sound of feet, as well as of men whispering, came
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“If this big man at the table hears it, too, then there
will be a circus. I’ll take a wallop at him myself, so
long as I know I have friends to see that I get a square
deal.”</p>

<p>Chick did not want any more than an equal chance.
In fact, he was willing to give some odds. But he did
not think he was called upon to give cards and spades,
big and little casino, and everything else, to the enemy.</p>

<p>But it seemed now as if he must take a big, sporting
chance.</p>

<p>Just as he was gathering the little strength he had
left, to make a desperate attempt to overcome the giant
at the table, he was sure he had heard a noise in the
hall. There was no mistake about it now. Not only
in the hall, but upstairs!</p>

<p>The man at the table glanced upward, with a quick
start of alarm. From his throat came a low, angry
oath.</p>

<p>“The cops!” he added savagely.</p>

<p>Clutching the long knife he had been using for trimming
the plaster molds, he dashed to the door by which
he had entered and hurled himself out of the room.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad they’ve come!” gasped Chick. “It
may be too late to do me any good, but they’ll get even
for me if I have to pass it up. By Grimshaw, I believe
I’m dying!”</p>

<p>Things were reeling around him, and it was only by
coming in contact for an instant with a corner of the
hot stove that he was saved from swooning. He did
not realize it at the time, but doubtless that was the
way the sudden sting acted.</p>

<p>Crawling out from behind the furnace, he staggered
to the door. He wanted to be in the mix-up, if only he
could contrive to keep on his feet.</p>

<p>“I won’t follow that fellow,” was his half-conscious,
inward resolve. “But I’ll take it the other way—if
only I can get the door open before I drop. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
room is full of sulphur, and it seems to be getting
thicker.”</p>

<p>This was not really the case, but Chick had inhaled
so much of the deadly vapor that he felt as if he could
not stand any more, and each moment it had a worse
effect upon him.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he contrived to unlock the door, and
lurched into the hallway beyond.</p>

<p>The stairs to the cellar were before him. Avoiding
them, he made his way toward where fresh air was
streaming in at the open yard door.</p>

<p>“Air!” he panted.</p>

<p>As he reached the doorway, he uttered an ejaculation
of relief—and found himself in the grip of a pair
of powerful arms. He had been seized by one of the
policemen.</p>

<p>“All right, Bob!” shouted the officer, giving Chick a
shake as involuntarily he attempted to pull away. “I
have one of them!”</p>

<p>“Let go, you dub!” gasped Chick. “Don’t you know
who I am?”</p>

<p>“Sure I do. But I don’t want the story of your life.
Tell that to the captain when I get you to the station.”</p>

<p>He felt a row of knuckles grinding into the back of
his neck. Under ordinary conditions, when he was
himself, Chick could have made some sort of fight.
Probably he would have done so, even though he knew
it was useless to oppose a good policeman in the performance
of his duty.</p>

<p>As it was, however, being sick and faint, and having
hardly any strength, he suddenly collapsed, like an
empty sack, in the hands of the blue-coated captor.</p>

<h2 id="XII">CHAPTER XII.
<br />
<small>NICK SPRINGS A SURPRISE.</small></h2>


<p>During all this excitement, Patsy was trying to find
out where Chick was.</p>

<p>Patsy had found Nick and Lieutenant Brockton, in
charge of the squad that was to take part in the raid,
sitting in the captain’s room, smoking and wondering
how long it would be before Chick would give them
the signal.</p>

<p>They had expected it by telephone—that having
been the orders to Chick—and the lieutenant hardly
ever took his eyes off the instrument on the desk
before him.</p>

<p>When Patsy came bounding in, after a brief explanation
to the sergeant behind the desk, Nick was glad
his young assistant had taken this course. It enabled
Nick, as well as the lieutenant, to get a better idea of
the situation than if they had had it over a wire. Besides,
this way made it certain there could not be any
“leak.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Brockton did not quite like putting himself
and the policemen told off to him under the orders
of Nick Carter. But the detective would not consent
to any other arrangement, and the lieutenant was
obliged to comply. He could not afford to antagonize
Carter, who seemed to have a knowledge of everything
in the underworld, although he never boasted of it.</p>

<p>As they hurried to the house on foot—for Nick
would not allow the use of a patrol wagon, which
would have attracted general attention—Patsy gave the
detective a very good idea of the general plan of the
house.</p>

<p>“It’s just a few little things that ought to make it
easier to put one over on the gang,” he explained.
“You can’t know too much about a house when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
are going to get in suddenlike,” he added, with his
usual good-humored grin.</p>

<p>“You’re quite right, Patsy,” agreed Nick. “And, as
you say, the point we have to look out for particularly
is at the back. They might go scooting over the back
fence and get away by the other street.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Brockton stationed a couple of his
youngest and most agile men in the back yard. They
were down the alley at the side, and climbed over the
side fence.</p>

<p>A third man was placed in the alley, to remain there,
and two more went into the front yard, below the level
of the street. It was one of these two who afterward
distinguished himself by capturing Chick.</p>

<p>The remaining three men, with the lieutenant and
Nick Carter, went into the house, going in by the
front yard door, which Chick had carefully left unfastened,
as has been described.</p>

<p>Carter was in the lead. He pushed open the door
in the yard without difficulty, and swiftly mounted
to the floor above, where the artists in rascality were
at work.</p>

<p>They found the room at once. It was the only one
which showed a light under the door. Listening intently,
they made out voices and the click of tools
inside.</p>

<p>“Now,” whispered Nick to the men behind him.
“Follow close when I open the door. Don’t give them
time to rally from their first surprise! Get all that?”</p>

<p>“We have it,” grunted the lieutenant. “Drive on,
Carter!”</p>

<p>The detective turned the handle without any sound,
and flung the door wide open.</p>

<p>“Drop everything!” he commanded, in sharp, metallic
tones.</p>

<p>He had stepped into the room as coolly as if he lived
there. The lieutenant and his men were on his heels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and they were prepared to subdue any of the operators
who might show signs of resistance.</p>

<p>For a moment there was nothing of the kind. The
surprise was complete. The advent of the detective
and his men had been like a thunderbolt dropped into
this hive of misdirected industry.</p>

<p>The two men still at work on the polished plates at
the bench leaped up as if their chairs had suddenly
become red-hot. The fellow who had been examining
and passing upon the spurious bills sprang into the
middle of the room. With the movement, he scattered
thousands of dollars’ worth of phony money, like
leaves in a wintry gale. At the same time he grunted
a fierce but futile oath.</p>

<p>“Don’t make any fuss, gentlemen!” begged Nick
blandly. “You are all prisoners! Lieutenant, you and
your men attend to these parties. I have something
else to look after.”</p>

<p>“All right, Carter.” Then, to the prisoners, the lieutenant
went on: “The house is covered, back and
front. Don’t try to make a get-away. If you do, some
of you will get hurt, as sure as you’re here!”</p>

<p>“Here! Quit that!” shouted Nick. “Look out,
lieutenant!”</p>

<p>The detective had seen one of the raided counterfeiters
reaching for an iron bar under the bench, and
he gave instant warning. None of the others had noticed
the movement, but the detective had sharp eyes
and sharp wits. He was not to be fooled by any such
attempt as this.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the lieutenant or his men to
take action, Nick sprang upon the rascal even as he
shouted. By the time Brockton and his men had
hurled themselves into the fracas, Nick had taken
away the bar of iron, and the man who had wielded it
was lying on his back.</p>

<p>But Nick did not give much time to this little incident.
He disposed of it as a matter of course, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
having seen that the man was in the hands of two
of the policemen, he turned to the rocker in which the
elegant T. Burton Potter still slumbered as sweetly as
if he had been in a comfortable bed in a silent room.
He seemed to have heard nothing of the noise of the
raid.</p>

<p>“This will end a puzzling case,” muttered the detective,
as he pushed his way through the struggling
men—for all of the bench workers were at grips with
the police by this time. “Who would have expected
this? If I can only get to him before he wakes, why
I can——”</p>

<p>But Nick was not to have so much luck. The man
who called himself T. Burton Potter was a very wide-awake
young man, indeed, when once he <em>was</em> awake.
At a glance he saw what had occurred. He knew there
was a police raid, and he did not want to stay and
see how it would come out. He preferred to find his
way out himself.</p>

<p>“Deuce take him!” muttered Nick. “He always
was as quick as a cat! If he’d only stand still for a
second, he’d save me a great deal of trouble—and himself,
too.”</p>

<p>But T. Burton Potter did not see it that way. Leaping
from his chair, he swung it around, so that it
would be right in the detective’s way, and pushed in
between the bench and press.</p>

<p>Nick was not foiled by the chair, however. Agile as
a panther, he placed one hand lightly on the back of
the chair, and vaulted completely over it, at the same
moment stretching forth a hand to seize Potter.</p>

<p>But Potter had vaulted over the table and was
through the doorway before the detective could get
him, notwithstanding that he leaped over the table
just the splinter of a second behind the man he wanted
to capture.</p>

<p>But the rascal’s luck was with him. He reached the
top of a long flight of stairs to the basement, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
down them in a huddled heap, part of the time on his
feet, and the rest of it rolling down like a ball.</p>

<p>Again Carter was so close to him that he almost had
him, when a big man, with a knife in his hand, rushed
up from the bottom, and came right between them.</p>

<p>It was the man Chick had seen trimming off the
plaster molds in the old kitchen, while the metal boiled
on the stove that had so nearly been the death of Carter’s
principal assistant.</p>

<p>“Look out, Davis! The cops!” bellowed T. Burton
Potter. “It’s a raid! Hand him one! Croak him!”</p>

<p>The big man, whose name, it seemed, was Davis,
made a lunge at Nick with his long, dirty knife.</p>

<p>The detective was too quick for him, however.
Dodging the knife stroke, he feinted with his right
fist, and then sent his left straight into Davis’ face, between
the eyes.</p>

<p>The blow was a magnificent one from a boxer’s
point of view. Not only did it send Davis down the
few stairs up which he had come, but it drove him six
or eight feet along the hall.</p>

<p>It was not altogether satisfactory to Nick, however.
He had to dispose of the big man, of course. But, in
the meantime, T. Burton Potter was getting away.</p>

<p>Flying up the stairs, three at a time, the elegant-appearing
crook ran into the first room he came to,
which looked over the back yard.</p>

<p>Skipping to the window, he unlatched the sash and
threw it wide open. He intended to drop out to the
back yard. But just as he was ready to do so, he
saw two officers waiting to receive him, and he ran
back into the room.</p>

<p>“Euchred that way!” he muttered. “But I don’t
know. There are others. They haven’t landed me
yet.”</p>

<p>By this time Nick was at the doorway. He was just
in time to see Potter’s head and shoulders in outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
against the dim light of the window, and made a
spring to make him prisoner.</p>

<p>There was a derisive chuckle, and Potter slithered
around the dark walls of the room. The next moment,
as Nick advanced to the center of the chamber,
Potter had slipped out of the door.</p>

<p>“Confound the fellow! I almost had him!” exclaimed
Nick, in a low tone, and half inclined to laugh
at the slipperiness of the fellow. “He’s gone! Well,
I’ll have to begin all over again. If he knew what I
wanted him for, perhaps it would be different. But
I can’t tell him till I’ve had a chance to talk to him
and make a few notes for comparison.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="XIII">CHAPTER XIII.
<br />
<small>NICK CARTER’S QUIET HAND.</small></h2>


<p>What Nick meant by the last words he had uttered,
no doubt he could have told. As no one heard them,
and he was talking to himself, anyhow, presumably it
was nobody else’s business what he meant.</p>

<p>That there was something behind the detective’s
willingness to take part in such a raid as this, both
Chick and Patsy were sure, but neither knew just what
it was. There were some things that the chief did not
tell even to his most trusted employees.</p>

<p>That there had been a development in the room
raided which had disturbed for the moment even the
steady poise of the great detective, none knew but
himself.</p>

<p>In T. Burton Potter he had recognized one of the
men he most wanted to get hold of just now. The
other was Andrew Lampton, but he felt that he could
let the hunt for Lampton go for the present, until he
had his hands on the elegant Potter.</p>

<p>What was Potter doing while Nick laughed at the
cleverness of his escape from the room? Well, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
trying to achieve a get-away under extremely difficult
circumstances.</p>

<p>Once clear of the room where he had managed to
give the detective the slip, he made a half turn toward
the downward flight of stairs. But another officer
showed himself at the bottom. So he swung around
and dashed up the stairs to the floor above.</p>

<p>In the darkness, Nick was not sure whether his man
had gone up or down. This involved another loss of
a few moments. But his keen ear soon told him where
Potter was, and up the stairs he went after his man.</p>

<p>T. Burton Potter heard his pursuer, and he did not
dodge into any more rooms. Instead, he continued up
the stairs, flight after flight, with one last, desperate
hope in his heart—just one! That was that he might
escape by way of the roof.</p>

<p>He had one advantage over Nick, in that he knew
the house well, while this was the first visit of the detective.</p>

<p>Aided by this fact, and by the darkness, with many
twists and turns at landings and on the stairs themselves,
T. Burton Potter was in the garret at about
thirty seconds ahead of Nick.</p>

<p>He lost half that gain in unbolting a trapdoor and
forcing it open, so that he could crawl through to the
roof. It was a serious loss to him, for the detective
almost had him by the legs as he clambered through.
Before he could slam down the trap door, Nick was
out on the roof after him.</p>

<p>It is not an uncommon thing for detectives and uniformed
police officers to chase crooks over roofs. Some
thrilling experiences of this kind could be related by a
great many policemen, but each story of the pursuit
of some desperado over the roofs of skyscrapers has
features of its own that make it stand out from all
others.</p>

<p>It was so in this case.</p>

<p>The detective took a hasty survey, and saw that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
while the roofs ran along over the two houses, that
was as far as they did go. Every two houses were
separated from the next two by the width of a narrow
alley like that in which policemen were waiting below
to catch any of the fugitives from the raid.</p>

<p>“Come back! Don’t be a fool!” shouted Nick.</p>

<p>The man he was after had dashed along the roof,
and now was standing on the low parapet which protected
the roof on the side where it was divided from
the next house by the alley.</p>

<p>T. Burton Potter glanced back for an instant. He
could make out the form of the detective dimly in the
darkness. Then, without reply, he put all his strength
into a tremendous leap, and went off the parapet!</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” exclaimed Nick. “He couldn’t
jump that. At least, I don’t see how he could. It
is not less than nine feet, and he hadn’t any run to
help him.”</p>

<p>So sure was the detective that Potter could not have
jumped the gap that he hurried down the stairs to the
parlor floor, where he met Brockton.</p>

<p>“Got them all, Brockton?”</p>

<p>“All except Lampton and that fellow you were after.
I mean, the dude who was sleeping in the chair.
Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Jumped off the roof. He’s in the alley at the side
of the house. Send some of your men to look. He
tried to leap from one roof to the next. That was
craziness. He couldn’t do it, of course. And he took
such a risk for the sake of avoiding a term in prison.
Why, it’s sixty feet. There can’t be anything left
of him.”</p>

<p>But not a vestige of Potter could they find, and Nick
could believe only that he had really made the seeming
impossible leap.</p>

<p>When the prisoners had been safely conveyed to the
police station, to be dealt with in due course by the
government officers, Nick went around there himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to make his report of what had taken place under his
supervision.</p>

<p>That was merely a dry, official proceeding, and
Nick, wearied of the whole business, and more disgusted
than he would have cared to acknowledge over
the way T. Burton Potter had escaped him, was about
to go out of the station to the taxi he had ordered,
when Brockton remarked casually:</p>

<p>“We have one prisoner who has a queer story to
tell. He says he is your assistant?”</p>

<p>“What?” shouted Nick.</p>

<p>“He’s a young fellow. We didn’t see him in the
room with the others. But he’s one of the gang. He
was trying to slip out of the door into the front
when one of my men grabbed him.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>Nick interrupted the narration curtly, and a black
frown gathered over his keen eyes and brought his
heavy brows together.</p>

<p>“In a cell, of course.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you his name?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. That was more of it. He had the
nerve to say his name was Chick Carter, your assistant!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! And you’ve arrested a man
against whom you have no case, even when he told
you he was my assistant, and that his name was Chick
Carter. Didn’t you think it worth while to make any
inquiries?”</p>

<p>“No. We——”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it occur to anybody in this police station
that he might be telling the truth?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Mr. Carter,” answered the lieutenant
at the desk. “We put the name he gave us on the blotter.
We always do that, even when we know it isn’t
the real name. We have so many arrests where men
say their name is something entirely different from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
one they give. We have no time to make inquiries into
that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Let me see this prisoner—this man Chick Carter!”
demanded Nick.</p>

<p>The lieutenant called out to the doorman to bring
Chick up from below.</p>

<p>There was silence until the door opened. Nick was
frowning, and every officer in the big station looked
worried. They began to feel that there had been a
mistake somewhere.</p>

<p>“Here he is, lieutenant!”</p>

<p>It was the uniformed officer in charge of the cells
who spoke, and he held by the elbow no less a person
than Chick.</p>

<p>“Hello, chief!” he cried, as he saw his employer.
“Can’t you get me out of this?”</p>

<p>But he was already free. No sooner had the officer
holding him seen the look of recognition on the
detective’s face than he released his hold of the prisoner’s
elbow.</p>

<p>“What’s this mean, Chick?” asked his chief.</p>

<p>“Search me!” laughed Chick. “One of the men
grabbed me because he found me in the house, just
coming out of the yard door, to take a hand in the
raid with you.”</p>

<p>“The officer said he was drunk!” growled Lieutenant
Brockton rather defiantly. “I suppose there must
have been some reason for his making that statement.”</p>

<p>“I reckon there was,” conceded Chick. “I had been
baked behind a stove where they were making silver
dollars and halves, and what with the heat and the
fumes of charcoal and hot metal, I was nearly a goner.
Then I had a scrap with the officer, and——”</p>

<p>“If you’d been in such a place as that, behind a
stove, it probably made you dizzy, didn’t it, Chick?”</p>

<p>It was Nick who asked the question, and, as he did
so, he looked scornfully at Lieutenant Brockton.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think, chief?” was Chick’s response.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
“I don’t mind saying that if I seemed a drunk,
I don’t blame the officer. I dare say, if I had been
in his place, I should have made the same mistake.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you would,” threw in the lieutenant.
“When you came in, you looked as if you had one of
the worst souses that ever came into this station. But
I am very sorry the mistake occurred.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” declared Chick, grinning, but with tremendous
earnestness at the same time.</p>

<p>“I’ll scratch your name off the blotter,” went on the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” returned Chick dryly. “What was the
charge against me? ‘Drunk, resisting an officer, and
suspicious character,’ I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it exactly,” was the reply of the lieutenant.
“But it will all be obliterated. I hope there
are no hard feelings.”</p>

<p>“None on my part, now that I am out,” declared
Chick.</p>

<p>To prove it, he shook hands all around, including
Lieutenant Brockton and the desk lieutenant and doorkeeper.
Then he went out to the taxi with his chief.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry all this happened, chief,” said Chick
contritely, as the cab got under way. “But the officers
wouldn’t listen to a word from me. They threatened
to dust me with their clubs if I didn’t shut up. So, of
course, I had to shut up.”</p>

<p>“The wisest thing to do under the circumstances,”
answered Nick in an absent tone. “We will stay in
the taxi even on the ferryboat, unless you feel that you
must get out for the fresh air of the river.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do what you do, chief,” returned Chick. “How
did the raid come out? You look worried. Was anything
wrong about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Very much wrong.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“We did not capture Andrew Lampton, for one
thing, and we missed T. Burton Potter, for another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s T. Burton Potter?” asked Chick, puzzled.
“He’s a new one on me.”</p>

<p>“He is not a new one to me, although to-night was
the first time I’ve seen him—by that name.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me going, chief,” confessed Chick.
“I’m blessed if I know what you are talking about.”</p>

<p>“I’m talking about T. Burton Potter. He is dressed
in a way that I never saw Howard Milmarsh. But if
Potter is not Howard, then I’m afraid I shall find it
hard to believe my own eyes hereafter.”</p>

<br />
<small>WITH THE TIDE.</small></h2>


<p>The look of amazement on the face of Chick, as he
heard this extraordinary statement, as he considered
it, compelled Nick to laugh aloud, bothered as he was
just then.</p>

<p>There was no light in the cab, but they happened to
be passing a lighted restaurant at that moment, and
Nick had a good view of his companion’s face.</p>

<p>“What’s that, chief?” gasped Chick. “Won’t you
say it again?”</p>

<p>“I will if you like. I say, that T. Burton Potter is
so much like the heir to the Milmarsh millions, that
I cannot think they are not the same person.”</p>

<p>“But—but—this Potter is a crook!” protested
Chick.</p>

<p>“That is what makes the case so difficult to handle,”
replied Nick. “If Potter were an honest, reputable
member of society, I should not have to proceed so
carefully. As it is——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence. He felt that it was
not necessary. He leaned back in the taxi, and not another
word was spoken by either until the cab had
been run upon the ferryboat. Then the chief remarked
that the smell of horses was rather strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and that they might as well go to the front of the
boat to get the night air on the wide river.</p>

<p>They got out of the cab, Nick telling the taxi
driver they would get in again before the ferryboat tied
up in her slip, and walked to the front of the deck on
the men’s side, where Nick could continue to smoke his
cigar without breaking rules.</p>

<p>Having looked about him, to make sure there were
no eavesdroppers, he explained to his assistant how it
was this case interested him so much.</p>

<p>“You know, Chick, that when we left Maple, and
after we had pretty well combed out all the camps
in that part of the country, to make sure neither Andrew
Lampton nor Howard Milmarsh were in any of
them, we came to the conclusion that they must have
made their way East.”</p>

<p>“It was you came to the conclusion—not I,” corrected
Chick. “I did not decide anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s of no consequence. Anyhow, it turned
out that I was right, for Andrew Lampton was traced
by the police to New York, where he then disappeared,
and I believe I saw Howard Milmarsh to-night in the
person of T. Burton Potter.”</p>

<p>“That’s a hard thing to get through my head,” confessed
Chick.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder. But I had a good view of Potter,
and every lineament was that of Howard Milmarsh.
His hair was the same color, the expression
of the eyes was the same, and there was a certain poise
to his head that I had never seen except in Howard.
I did not hear his voice, but no doubt that would only
have confirmed my belief that he was the son of my
old friend, Howard Milmarsh the elder, whose business,
estate, and millions of dollars are seeking their
rightful heir.”</p>

<p>“There is somebody else after the estate, isn’t
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is why I do not feel at liberty to waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
time over this case,” replied the chief gravely. “If
we do not find Howard Milmarsh, then Thomas Jarvis,
the father of Richard Jarvis—the man Howard
believes he killed—will probably claim everything. He
is the heir at law if Howard cannot be found.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anybody else besides that fellow?”</p>

<p>“No. He is the only member of the family known
to be living. I understand he will put in a claim—although
he is related to the Milmarshes only by marriage,
and has no blood connection. I have never
seen this Thomas Jarvis. But I <em>know</em> something
about him.”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t have to think about him, chief, do
we, if you are sure this man Potter is Howard Milmarsh?
And even if he were not the man, we saw
Howard in Maple—or at least, you did—and he is
still on earth in some shape or other.”</p>

<p>The ferryboat had been skimming across the North
River in the darkness, and was rapidly approaching
the Manhattan line of shore, with the masses of
twinkling lights in the many skyscrapers, and the occasional
sound of bells, whistles, and other signals
warning craft to be careful as they approached the
wharves.</p>

<p>“There’s the green and red lights of our slip not far
ahead,” remarked Chick. “But we don’t have to get
back to the taxi till we are right in. Are we going
right home?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I want to refer to some memoranda I have
there, and I can telephone more conveniently from my
own library than anywhere else. We’ll go home
and——”</p>

<p>Nick broke off suddenly and ran to the middle of
the wagonway on the boat.</p>

<p>For an instant he seemed inclined to leap over the
gates, so that he could see better whatever it was that
had caught his eye, and which had made him oblivious
of all else?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Chick was by the detective’s side, and both were
staring at the dark river in front of them, but somewhat
to starboard.</p>

<p>What they saw was startling enough to warrant
the interest of Nick Carter—a man who seldom allowed
himself to become excited, or he would have
been so now.</p>

<p>A rowboat—a yawl—was moving swiftly toward
the Manhattan shore, propelled by two men, and helped
along considerably by the outgoing tide.</p>

<p>The tide caught them in such a way that, while it
forced them downstream to some degree, also took
them across the river, and soon would put the boat
among the tangle of piles supporting some of the big
wharves below the ferry slip.</p>

<p>The two men were T. Burton Potter and—Patsy
Garvan.</p>

<p>“Thunder and lightning!” burst out from Chick.
“How did Patsy get him? Say, chief, he’s beaten
both of us!”</p>

<p>“All the better!” responded Nick. “I don’t care
who gets Potter so long as we have him at last.”</p>

<p>“What are we to do now?”</p>

<p>“Trust to Patsy,” was the chief’s reply. “What else
can we do?”</p>

<p>Chick nodded. As the chief had said, what else
could they do?</p>

<p>“We couldn’t jump off this boat, Chick. And if we
did, it would not help us at all. Patsy is sure to have
some plan in his mind. It isn’t likely Potter knows
who is in the boat with him, and I think we can depend
on the shrewdness of Patsy.”</p>

<p>“I believe that, too,” mumbled Chick. “But I envy
him his luck. I wish I were in that boat, instead of
him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be jealous,” laughed the detective. “You
should be above that. Patsy deserves all he has, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
he must have exercised judgment to have brought
about what we see—the fellow we want so badly. T.
Burton Potter, sitting there and rowing himself
straight into the arms of the police.”</p>

<p>“I hope that will happen,” responded Chick. “The
boat is out of sight now, for we are in the slip. We
may as well get into our taxi. But I certainly have
had beastly luck this night.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had plenty of experience, at least, Chick,”
laughed his employer.</p>

<p>It did not take long for the taxi to run up to the
detective’s home. In less than half an hour from the
time they saw Patsy in the yawl with Potter, Carter
was in his usual seat behind his big table, reading a
short telephone message which had come about an
hour before, and which the butler, who knew a great
deal of the detective’s business, had taken and left
for him, in the shape of a written note, on his table.</p>

<p>The note read, in the words that had come over the
wire:</p>

<p>“This is Patsy. Have man. More later. Just coming
over from Jersey City to New York.”</p>

<p>Nick read the memorandum two or three times,
considering as he did so. Then a slight smile broke
over his thoughtful countenance, as he looked at Chick
and murmured:</p>

<p>“Patsy must have got to a telephone just before he
entered the boat with Potter.”</p>

<p>“But how the dickens did he get into a boat with
Potter?” asked Chick, in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>“My theory is that Patsy traced Potter down to the
river in some way, saw that he wanted a boat to get
across without having to take the ferry, and quickly
took advantage of the situation.”</p>

<p>“Patsy is smart enough to do that,” admitted Chick.</p>

<p>“Of course he is. He knows everybody along the
river front. It wouldn’t be much of a feat for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
get possession of a yawl and pretend to Potter that
he was the owner.”</p>

<p>“By George! That’s what it looks like!”</p>

<p>“It does. But we don’t know till we hear from
Patsy.”</p>

<p>“There doesn’t seem to be any way to get hold of
Patsy. I suppose we shall have to wait,” remarked
Chick. “We ought to be doing something in the meantime,
I should think. What do you intend to do until
Patsy comes or lets us know?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think our best proceeding would be to have
the butler bring us up a sandwich or two and some
good coffee. If you’re not hungry, I am,” replied
the chief, with a smile.</p>

<h2 id="XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br />
<small>TRACKED!</small></h2>


<p>It may be interesting to know just how T. Burton
Potter did escape from the roof when he made that
desperate leap in the darkness across the width of the
alley.</p>

<p>Almost any athlete would not think much of clearing
nine or ten feet between marks on the ground,
with everything favorable for the feat. Such performances
are done at most athletic meets without
causing surprise or any other particular emotion.</p>

<p>But, sixty feet up in the air, with the certainty that
any slip would mean crashing down on hard stones,
a heap of mangled nothingness, it was a different thing.</p>

<p>If T. Burton Potter had stopped to think for a
second, he might have hesitated. It would have been
no reflection on his courage if he had. But he had
no time to think, and over he went.</p>

<p>For a few seconds after landing safely on the other
roof, he lay down behind the parapet. He had two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
reasons for this. One was to recover his breath, and
the other was to keep out of sight of his pursuers.</p>

<p>“Unless he jumps after me, I’ve got him buffaloed,”
whispered Potter to himself, with a dry chuckle. “I
wouldn’t do it again for a million. What would be
the use of fifty millions, even, to a dead man? Now,
how am I to get out of this?”</p>

<p>Keeping under cover of the parapet, he crawled
around to the rear of the roof. There was no parapet
here—only an iron gutter. The gutter ran along
to the end of the roof and emptied into an iron pipe
which went straight down to the ground. At least,
Potter supposed it did. He could not see in the darkness.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to take another chance,” he muttered. “And
it looks worse than the other, when I jumped. I don’t
like it, but what can I do? I don’t intend to be caught.
I believe even a week in a prison would kill me, unless
it drove me insane.”</p>

<p>Lying flat upon the roof, he gripped the pipe firmly.
Then, gingerly, he lowered himself over the edge of
the roof and pinched the pipe between his knees.</p>

<p>With a double hold on it, hands and knees, he began
to inch downward!</p>

<p>“If this pipe should fetch loose, I’m a goner! I
hope it will hold. But it seems awfully shaky.”</p>

<p>The pipe creaked from time to time, and more than
once he heard the rusty spikes which held it to the
wall in the rotting mortar grating, as if they were
about to pull out.</p>

<p>But the thing held somehow, and in about ten minutes
he was safely on the ground, uttering a prayer
of thankfulness for his luck—for he was not what
could be called a pious man.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind which way he would go
if he reached the ground, and that was over the back
fence. Blessed with uncommon agility, as well as
hardened muscles, he swarmed over the high fence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
without much difficulty. Then, after sitting astride
for a moment or two, he dropped on the other side.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for him that all the police had withdrawn.
They had concluded, when the raid was over,
that there would not be any men trying to get away
in the rear. If they thought anything about T. Burton
Potter, they had decided that he was clear away.</p>

<p>The other side of the high fence only brought him
into another back yard, and he saw that the houses
were as high as those on Salisbury Street.</p>

<p>“If there’s a side alley and gate, I can make it
easily,” he murmured. “Durn my luck, there isn’t!”
he added a moment later, after a hasty survey. “The
house is the full width of the yard.”</p>

<p>There were high, wooden fences on both sides. But
he did not see that climbing over them, one after
another, was likely to help him. Sooner or later he
would run into somebody in one of the yards. Then
he would have to explain why he was there, and he
<em>might</em> have to tell his story to the chief of police.</p>

<p>“I won’t take any risk of meeting that gentleman,
or any of his men, if it can be helped.”</p>

<p>T. Burton Potter came to this decision very quickly,
and with much earnestness. For reasons of his own,
he did not care to be brought into contact with blue
coats and brass buttons on that night of all others.</p>

<p>“It will be daylight in course of time,” he reflected.
“Then I should <em>have</em> to find my way out. I wonder
if I can’t get through this house. It’s the only chance
I have!”</p>

<p>He stole up to the back door. It was locked and
bolted, of course.</p>

<p>“Didn’t suppose there would be any chance that
way,” he muttered. “But there’s a little window, belonging
to a pantry, I guess. By Jove! It’s open,
I see. That’s to let air into the place, for the benefit
of the milk or butter or something.”</p>

<p>The window was too high for Mr. Potter to reach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but, as has been remarked several times, he was an
athlete, and as active as a monkey. With a short,
swift run, he managed to leap up and catch the sill
with his fingers.</p>

<p>It was not easy to pull himself up, and, if he had
not been in good physical training, he never could
have accomplished the feat. As it was, he was up
and peering through the open window in a few seconds.</p>

<p>To lower himself inside was the work of another
ten or fifteen moments. The door of the pantry—for
a pantry it was—had not been fastened, and he was
in the lower hall, making for the stairs, while a slower
man might have been trying to work his way through
the window opening.</p>

<p>Up the kitchen stairs and into the main hall he
rushed. There were some complicated bolts and locks
on the front door, and it took him some time to overcome
them. What was worse, he could not do it
without noise.</p>

<p>Potter had a vision of a man in pajamas suddenly
appearing at the top of the stairs on the second flight,
with a lamp in one hand and a pistol in the other.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” squeaked the man, evidently frightened
out of his senses. “Hands up, or I’ll fire!”</p>

<p>But T. Burton Potter had the door open by this
time.</p>

<p>“Fire and be blowed!”</p>

<p>He yelled this back defiantly as he rushed out and
slammed the door behind him.</p>

<p>“I’m glad the fool didn’t fire, all the same,” muttered
Potter. “It would have made racket enough to
bring the policeman on post, anyhow, and I don’t
want to see any of those gentry until I’ve had time
to compose myself. Whew! I wish I were in good
old New York.”</p>

<p>He walked leisurely along when he had turned the
corner, for he knew that a running man, or even one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
walking swiftly, might be questioned by the first policeman
he met.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anybody about. Just as well. I’ll get
down to the ferryhouse and slip across. I hope there
won’t be any one around there who knows me. You
never know where the police will put a man.”</p>

<p>T. Burton Potter was a slick individual, and he had
the faculty of seeing all around him without appearing
to stare. But, smart as he was, he did not perceive
a man who had seen him come out of the house
where the person in pajamas had threatened to shoot,
and who was following him as closely as possible
without being discovered.</p>

<p>“Gee! What luck! I knew he’d try to get through
some of these houses if he made a get-away,” muttered
this individual.</p>

<p>It may be hardly necessary to remark that the individual
was none other than Patsy Garvan. It was,
indeed, Nick Carter’s assistant.</p>

<p>He called it “luck” that he was on the trail of Potter
when no one else was. But it was really shrewdness,
reënforced by patience.</p>

<p>Patsy had figured out that when the raid came, the
men would scatter in all directions if they could. The
police would try to prevent this, of course. But some
of the gang were liable to slip through their net, and
it was Patsy’s opinion that, if any of them escaped,
the slick T. Burton Potter would be one of them.</p>

<p>While the chief and Chick were in the Northwest,
Patsy had been on another case, and had brought it
to a successful issue. What this case was does not
matter. But it is interesting to know that, as he followed
it up, he got, just before the return of his chief
and Chick, a side glance at T. Burton Potter. He
had had his own suspicions that the rascal was mixed
up in this counterfeiting affair.</p>

<p>Potter walked swiftly toward the river, but before
he reached the ferryhouse he resolved that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
would be too risky for him to cross the water that
way, and he plunged into a district with which he was
fairly well familiar, down among the wharves, to see
if he could hire a boat without making anybody suspicious.</p>

<p>Nick had been quite right in his belief that Patsy
had managed to pass himself off as the owner of the
yawl in which he and Potter were rowing. That was
exactly what he had done.</p>

<p>As they neared the place on the Manhattan side
where Patsy had decided to land, Potter paid him the
dollar he demanded for rowing him across, and darted
out of sight while Patsy was putting the money in his
pocket.</p>

<p>Patsy grinned, as he leaped upon the wharf right
on the heels of his late passenger, and, after hiding
behind some freight till Potter walked away, followed
him until he had reached the street.</p>

<p>Then followed a chase through the tortuous streets
of lower New York, until T. Burton Potter rushed
up a stairway to the elevated road at South Ferry.
Patsy was not far behind him—so near, in fact, that
he contrived to be on the same Sixth Avenue train
that carried Potter uptown to Eighth Street.</p>

<p>At this station Potter got off, and Patsy, who had
been in the next car, also dropped off and hid himself
in the shadows until Potter went down the stairs.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour Patsy rapped at the door
of Nick Carter’s library and walked in, cool and collected,
to find his chief busy with some papers at his
big table, and alone.</p>

<p>Nick looked up calmly.</p>

<p>“I was expecting you, Patsy,” he said.</p>

<p>“I came as soon as I could,” was Patsy’s response.</p>

<p>“Where’s your man?”</p>

<p>“My man?”</p>

<p>“T. Burton Potter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Patsy could not help showing surprise in his look
and tone, and Nick regarded him imperturbably.</p>

<p>“How did you know, chief?”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you to him if you like. But you’ll have
to break into a house.”</p>

<p>“Very well. We’ll break in,” answered Nick, as
if the act of burglary were a matter of everyday experience.
“Tell Chick. I’ve sent him to his room to
lie down for a while. He’ll have a very short rest,
from the look of things.”</p>

<h2 id="XVI">CHAPTER XVI.
<br />
<small>A SECRET OFFER.</small></h2>


<p>The house to which Patsy tracked T. Burton Potter
was one of those old-fashioned residences of the
kind in which the wealthy and exclusive members of
New York’s society lived half a century ago, and
which are plentiful in some of those quiet streets in
the neighborhood of Washington Square.</p>

<p>There are gardens in front of some of them, just
as there were fifty years ago, and at the back there
are still other gardens, with flower beds and trees, in
which people who have their homes in these pleasant
localities stroll about on summer evenings.</p>

<p>Many of the houses are now devoted to boarders
and lodgers, but a few are, to this day, occupied by
private families who can afford the luxury of a whole
house.</p>

<p>It was into a private house that T. Burton Potter
injected himself by way of the kitchen door under
the high stone steps leading to the main entrance above.
He had a key to this door.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he whispered to himself. “Things look
different. By Jove! Suppose I don’t find Lampton
here! He is the only one of the crowd that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
know me. Well, I can explain. But what have they
changed things for? It is only three weeks since I
was here before.”</p>

<p>Cautiously, he went out of the kitchen in which he
had first found himself, and up the stairs to the main
hall.</p>

<p>At every step he realized that there had been changes
since his last visit. The carpet was not the same, and
when he got to the hall, where a dim gas jet burned,
he saw that the hall rack was one he never had seen
before, and that there were pictures on the walls which
were strange to him.</p>

<p>He turned into a room which had been used as a
sort of sitting room by the assemblage of shady characters
who had made this house a sort of private clubhouse
when he had known it before, although it passed
to outsiders as the home of two wealthy families.</p>

<p>“Why, this room is altogether different,” muttered
Potter. “There is a handsome sideboard over there,
and I see silver enough to tempt anybody. I’ll bet
the gang has moved out, and that somebody else has
moved in. Now, what is this all about?”</p>

<p>Puzzled, he went into the front room, which was
separated only by portières, and found that it was a
luxuriously furnished apartment, with a piano and
many pictures on the walls, which he was connoisseur
enough to know were valuable.</p>

<p>He went out to the hall in a state of bewilderment
and somewhat frightened, too—for he knew he was
in a house in which the police might say he had no
right to be. Why hadn’t they changed the lock on the
lower door? Then he couldn’t have let himself in, and
he might have been saved all this.</p>

<p>He would get out as quickly as he could. This was
the only safe move for him!</p>

<p>He stole along the hall, intending to make his exit
by the door which had admitted him, when, suddenly
he perceived his own shadow on the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>You can’t have a shadow without a light, and involuntarily
Potter looked up the stairs.</p>

<p>What he saw was a great deal like what had scared
him in the house in Jersey City. A man, with a lamp
in one hand and a revolver in the other, was coming
down the stairs!</p>

<p>There were points of difference between this man
and the one in Jersey City, however. This man was
dressed in a well-fitting business suit, and he did not
look at all frightened. The hand that held the revolver
was ominously steady.</p>

<p>“Ha!” growled the man with the revolver.</p>

<p>T. Burton Potter did not say anything. It seemed
to him that there was nothing to be said.</p>

<p>The man who had said “Ha!” had a hard face, as
well as hard voice. The eyes that were transfixing
T. Burton Potter were fierce and sparkling. Potter
thought they looked like the heads of polished steel
rivets. Under the heavy, iron-gray brows, they were
enough to take the nerve out of even as daring a man
as Potter really was.</p>

<p>“Don’t reach for a gun,” continued the man on the
stairs. “This one in my hand has a mighty easy trigger,
and I may remind you that I have you covered.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got a gun!” grumbled Potter. “If I had,
I’m sensible enough to know when I’m beaten. What
I want to say——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say it,” ordered the other. “And don’t
try to get away down those kitchen stairs. Throw up
your hands and step into that room at the side—the
dining room. Then I’ll telephone for the police.”</p>

<p>“What for? I haven’t done anything. If you’ll
let me explain——”</p>

<p>But again the man with the gun shut him off, as
he came down to the hall, making Potter precede him
into the dining room.</p>

<p>“Go through this room into that other room at the
back. I use it for a library.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Potter obeyed. He knew the room well enough. It
had been used for card playing when the house was
occupied by its former tenants. It overlooked the back
garden, and had always been a favorite lounge of his
when he had had time to loaf a little.</p>

<p>With his hands up in the air, and looking very much
like a cornered desperado in the moving pictures, Potter
took his stand against the opposite wall, as his captor
commanded, and waited for what might come.</p>

<p>The man took up a telephone from the heavy table
in the middle of the room, at the same time switching
on a bunch of electric lights depending from the
ceiling, and which illuminated the room brilliantly.
As he did so, he looked into Potter’s face and started
violently.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Howard Milmarsh!” he blurted
out, putting the telephone down, but keeping the revolver
in a firm grip. “What does this mean? Why
have you come here? You know me, don’t you? I
was head waiter at the Old Pike Inn, and I was there
the night you—you——”</p>

<p>“What are you handing me?” demanded T. Burton
Potter, his surprise getting the better of his fear.
“I don’t know anybody named Howard Milmarsh.
My name is Potter, and I used to live here.”</p>

<p>“Live here? Why did you live here? Why did you
hide yourself when you could have a fortune by asking
for it—by just showing yourself?”</p>

<p>“I know all about these fortunes!” returned Potter.
“I seem to remember you as a waiter at the Old
Pike Inn, however.”</p>

<p>“Head waiter!” corrected the other. “I was studying
law all the time I was there, and now I have a
pretty fair business in New York, although I don’t
have to depend on fees for my living. I have other
means.”</p>

<p>T. Burton Potter, still with his hands up, stared at
this man thoughtfully. What passed in his mind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Potter’s own secret. He may have had no deeper purpose
than to get out of the house—or he may have
had other ideas.</p>

<p>“Stand still there for a minute. If you are willing
to listen to a proposition, I think I can show you how
you can make some money—more than you’ve ever
had in your life, and without having to work for it.”</p>

<p>“That would suit me,” declared Potter earnestly.</p>

<p>“No doubt. It would suit most men of your stripe.
Let me find out for myself whether you have any
weapons about you. Turn your face to the wall.”</p>

<p>In a minute or two the man of the house had been
through Potter’s pockets and found that he had told
the truth. Potter knew that there was a law making
it a criminal offense to carry deadly weapons, and he
was too cautious to take a chance of being caught with
anything of the kind. Besides, he did not believe in
murder.</p>

<p>“Put your hands down, and have a drink,” said the
stern man, when he was satisfied that Potter was not
armed. “You will notice that my gun is ready for
action, at my finger ends. There’s a bottle on that
table at your side, and glasses. Drink! I don’t care
for any myself.”</p>

<p>T. Burton Potter had had a hard night, and he was
willing to refresh himself with a little liquor.</p>

<p>“Now listen to me,” said the strange host. “I have
something to say.”</p>

<p>For an hour the two men were in close confab.
What they were talking about may be revealed later.
For the present, it is enough to say that the man told
his unexpected guest to call him Louden Powers, and
that henceforth T. Burton Potter must remember his
own name was—something else.</p>

<p>It would have surprised both the gentlemen in that
back room if they had known that they had for all
that time been under the eye of one who never did a
thing, no matter how strange it might appear, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
with a set purpose—Nick Carter, the world-renowned
detective.</p>

<p>Yet it was true. Nick had “broken in,” as he had
told Patsy Garvan he might. He had not had much
trouble, for T. Burton Potter had forgotten to lock
the door after letting himself in.</p>

<p>The detective had come in that way, about the time
Louden Powers was absorbed in the business of keeping
Potter under his pistol while he parleyed with him
in the library.</p>

<p>If Powers had not been so much taken up with his
prisoner, he might have been more careful. In that
case, he might have looked into the dining room, to
make sure neither of his two servants—who slept at
the top of the house—were spying on him. That
would have meant that Nick must have dodged.</p>

<p>As it was, there was nothing of the kind, and he
merely stood behind a big chair and looked over the
top of it until the conference between the two persons
in the back room came to an end.</p>

<p>“You will sleep in this house till we get things going,”
were the closing words of Louden Powers. “I
live here entirely alone, except for my two maidservants
and a man who drives my car and does heavy
work about the house. The maids and the man are
all Scandinavians, and they can’t speak English. They
say they can’t, at least, but I watch them, anyhow.
Now, let’s go up to bed. I’ll show you your room.”</p>

<p>Nick stayed in the dining room until the house was
quite quiet, and he figured Louden Powers and his
man were both asleep.</p>

<p>Then he went down to the back door to let himself
out, with a satisfied smile on his face.</p>

<p>As he reached the front gate of the little garden in
front of the house, Patsy came rushing up to him out
of the darkness, panting from a hard run.</p>

<p>“Chief!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s beat it!”</p>

<p>“Beat it? Who?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He got out of a third-story window,
on that old iron balcony. He let himself down to the
other, and then got to the ground. Chick and I were
waiting for him. But he got over a side fence and
was gone before we were on to his game.”</p>

<p>“And you let him get away?”</p>

<p>The sternness in Nick’s voice made Patsy wilt.</p>

<p>“Chick is after him. But it’s awfully dark, and
I don’t figure that he will ever catch up. I feel mighty
bad over it. But it was all done so quickly that we
didn’t have a chance. I thought I’d better be here
in case you came out.”</p>

<p>“Louden Powers locked him in his room, and, of
course, he got away by the window,” said the chief,
more to himself than to Patsy. “I should have been
out here sooner, I suppose. Come on, Patsy! We’ll
go home.”</p>

<br />
<small>WHAT NICK CARTER KNEW.</small></h2>


<p>For two days Nick Carter and his assistants tried
to find T. Burton Potter, but without result.</p>

<p>Chick had not been able to follow the man who
escaped from the third-story window of Louden Powers’
house. In the darkness and among the crooked
streets that run west from Sixth Avenue, in the neighborhood
of Jefferson Market, it was not difficult for
a quick-moving fellow like Potter to elude even such
a keen pursuer as Chick.</p>

<p>Nick did not reproach Chick for his ill success.
After his first disappointment, the famous detective
took his usual philosophical view of the set-back. He
never mourned over what could not be helped.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the second day, while Chick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and Garvan both were out, trying to get some clew to
the whereabouts of the much-wanted Potter, that Nick
strolled over to the East Side, and dropped into a
rather pretentious saloon—one of the kind that calls
itself a “café”—in Third Avenue.</p>

<p>The detective had not disguised himself in the ordinary
sense. But he wore a cap, instead of his usual
well-brushed hat of latest style, and he had on a long
raincoat, which concealed the rest of his attire. It
had been raining a little, which gave him an excuse
for the raincoat.</p>

<p>There were a number of men in the large, overdecorated
barroom, and it was easy for him to step
up to the bar and order a Scotch highball without
being observed particularly.</p>

<p>He sipped his highball slowly, while his keen eyes
gazed over the rim of his glass, taking in the whole
assemblage, one by one.</p>

<p>At last he picked out a rather burly man, who was
sitting at a table by himself, with an evening paper
held up so that only occasional glimpses of his face
could be obtained. One of those glimpses had told
him who the man was.</p>

<p>“Andrew Lampton!” he breathed softly. “And, in
the same person, my old friend, Joe Stokes! I thought
I might catch him here. That is the advantage of
having friends in the underworld.”</p>

<p>He strode over to the table, and looked over the
top of the paper, and said, in low, distinct tones:</p>

<p>“Lampton, I want you!”</p>

<p>The man made a quick movement toward his side
pocket. As he did so, the muzzle of an automatic
pistol broke its way through the paper, and he kept
his hand still.</p>

<p>“All right! I cave!” he growled. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter if you don’t know me,” was the
detective’s reply. “But I believe you do. Wait a
moment!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Dexterously, Nick dipped into the coat pocket from
which Lampton had meant to take something, and
from it lifted a businesslike automatic.</p>

<p>“Any more besides this, Andrew?”</p>

<p>“A knife in my inside waistcoat pocket,” he replied
briefly. “It’s in a sheath. Take it out if you like, but
I don’t mean to use it.”</p>

<p>“It would be foolish if you did,” returned Nick.
“Anyhow, I’m not here to arrest you. I want to talk
business.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so at first?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had time to say anything, first or last,”
rejoined the detective. “Have you anything on for
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may as well pick up that bundle of
money you’ve just dropped under the table. We can
burn it later.”</p>

<p>Andrew Lampton grinned and picked up a roll of
counterfeit bills which had been noticed by the sharp
eyes of the detective as soon as they were put on the
floor.</p>

<p>“Can’t fool you, Mr. Carter!”</p>

<p>“Not on some things, I hope. We are going to my
house. Any of your pals in this house?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of. Some of them were taken
in the raid in Jersey City the other night, and the
others are lying low for the present. I wasn’t in that
thing, but I heard about it.”</p>

<p>“I supposed you would,” said Nick, with a smile.
“Where’s T. Burton Potter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Tell the truth, Lampton.”</p>

<p>“I am telling it. Potter has vanished, and there
isn’t any of the gang know where he is exactly.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on. We’ll walk across. You don’t
mind the exercise, do you?”</p>

<p>Nick asked this question as politely as if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
been addressing some intimate friend. Lampton
grinned, as he answered, with equal courtesy:</p>

<p>“Not at all, I assure you. It will give me pleasure,
especially with an agreeable companion.”</p>

<p>They strolled out of the café together, and any person
who observed them might have said they were on
the best of terms. Nobody would have suspected that
Carter was keeping a sharp eye on the smiling man
at his side, and that he would have used his pistol if
that had been necessary to prevent his running away.</p>

<p>But nothing of the kind happened. Andrew Lampton
chatted on the topics of the day—the theaters,
politics, literature, and so forth. He did not mention
criminal matters, nor speak of anything that might
have the slightest bearing on his own favorite occupation,
“shoving the queer.” And yet the roll of phony
notes was still in his pocket, waiting to be burned as
soon as they should be in Nick’s home.</p>

<p>Once seated in the library, in an easy-chair, Lampton
handed the bills to the detective. The latter placed
them in a small brazier, and, with the aid of a certain
chemical, reduced them to ashes in an infinitesimal
space of time—much quicker than he could have
done it with simple fire.</p>

<p>“Rather a pity to see such good stuff burned up,”
remarked Andrew Lampton, with a wry smile, as he
began to puff on the perfecto Nick had passed to him.
“I don’t think better hundreds and fifties were ever
turned out, even in Washington.”</p>

<p>“It would have been more of a pity if they had been
left in your pocket,” answered the detective. “They
might have meant a five years’ stretch for you in a
Federal prison.”</p>

<p>“That’s immaterial,” laughed Lampton. “I expect
to be taken in sooner or later, if I stay in the game.
It’s only a question of time. Now, what do you want
me for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want those papers you took out of Howard Milmarsh’s
trunk in Maple, for the first thing.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Lampton, smoking comfortably.
“What next?”</p>

<p>“You are to go on with that trick you have arranged
with Louden Powers, to beat Howard Milmarsh out
of his fortune. You got the idea while you were
in the Northwest, the night we chased you through
the window.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was you who did it,” snarled
Lampton, frowning for the first time. “What do you
know about Louden Powers and me?”</p>

<p>“Everything!” was the quick reply. “You were to
see him to-night, at eleven o’clock. You’ll keep that
appointment, and, if you are wise, you won’t tell him
that you saw me this evening. Now, where is Potter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know! Curse him!”</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of the sincerity with which
Andrew Lampton uttered this malediction. Carter
was sure the fellow did not know what had become of
the man who seemed to be as slippery as a greased pig.</p>

<p>“Give me those papers belonging to Howard Milmarsh.
They are of no use to you now.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” grinned Lampton, recovering
his equanimity a little. “A man with those letters
and other documents would have no difficulty in
proving himself the real Howard Milmarsh, especially
when nature had made them so much alike that it is
difficult to tell one from the other.”</p>

<p>“Give me the papers!” repeated Nick, apparently
undisturbed by what the other had said. “I shall produce
the real Howard Milmarsh when the time comes,
never fear.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know now what you’ve brought me up
here for,” complained Lampton wearily. “I’ve had a
pleasant smoke—this cigar is excellent—but I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
rather have been left alone, to spend my evening in
my own way. What is the game?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” replied Nick, leaning easily back in
his chair and placing the end of his cigar in an ash
tray. “It’s a pretty story, and some people would call
it a romance.”</p>

<p>“Drive on!”</p>

<p>“Howard Milmarsh disappeared a few years ago,
just after his father died. Howard did not know of
his father’s death, but he knows of it now. He hesitates
to come back and claim his estate for reasons I
need not repeat.”</p>

<p>“No, you need not repeat them,” broke out Lampton.
“I know them well enough. Keep on talking.”</p>

<p>“So you and your rascally friend, Louden Powers,
decided to produce a Howard Milmarsh, who might
claim the property, giving you and Powers each a fair
share—or what you would consider a fair share—of
the estate.”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense, Mr. Carter. Who’d believe such
a wild tale as that?”</p>

<p>“I would, when I have proof—and I have that,”
rejoined the detective. “The real Howard Milmarsh
has changed considerably in experience in the years
he has been away. You know that, because you saw
him at Maple, and you’ve seen him elsewhere. It
struck you that you knew a man who looked so much
like him that he might pass for the missing heir if he
were carefully coached.”</p>

<p>“Who is the man?”</p>

<p>“T. Burton Potter,” was the swift reply of the detective.</p>

<p>“Pooh!”</p>

<p>“That is the man,” went on Nick, disregarding the
contemptuous ejaculation. “I don’t care how you may
try to pretend otherwise. I <em>know</em>. He is so much
like Howard Milmarsh, that, in the first few moments
that I saw him, I was actually not sure myself. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
soon I saw him doing things that I knew would be impossible
to the man you want him to impersonate, and,
besides, there are minute points of difference which
anybody who knew Howard Milmarsh as well as I
would distinguish immediately.”</p>

<p>“T. Burton Potter is a gentleman of leisure, I’ve
been told,” grinned Andrew Lampton. “But as for
his being like Howard Milmarsh, I don’t know anything
about that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind your being a liar, Lampton,” retorted
Nick quietly. “But I wish you would not pretend to
be a stupid one. Did I not tell you that I <em>know</em>?”</p>

<p>“Why do you want me to go and see Louden Powers
to-night?”</p>

<p>The question came abruptly. Andrew Lampton had
seen that it would be useless to continue his bluffing
tactics with the detective.</p>

<p>“Go and see him and find out, if you can, where
T. Burton Potter is. I want him. And, before you
go, give me those letters and papers. You can’t use
them now, and Louden Powers might try to take them
from you if he knew they were in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if this game were about up,” commented
Lampton, as he handed over the bundle of
papers. “There they are! Just as I got them from
the trunk. I’ll have to depend on your good nature
now.”</p>

<p>“If you help me with this case, I’ll wipe everything
off the slate to date,” replied Nick. “Of course, what
you may do afterward is at your own risk.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and see Powers,” promised Lampton, rising
from his chair. “But I don’t believe he knows
where Potter is. By the way, what earthly use is T.
Burton Potter to you, if he is not the real Howard
Milmarsh?”</p>

<p>“I think Potter knows where Howard is,” answered
Flint. “He is a pretty slick scoundrel, and can keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
a secret. But I think I can swing some influence with
him, considering what I have found out about him.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I tumble,” laughed Lampton. “Another
thing I wanted to ask you. When you were chasing
him so hard on the night of the raid, didn’t you, honest,
believe he was the real Howard Milmarsh?”</p>

<p>“I did at first. I’ve already told you that.”</p>

<p>“And when did you find out that he wasn’t?”</p>

<p>“That’s my own private business,” rejoined the detective.
“Report to me here to-morrow night. That’s
all.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the door as a sign of dismissal.</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid that I’ll work up some scheme
against you, or beat it for parts unknown?” asked
Lampton, smiling. “You seem to feel sure I’ll obey
your orders.”</p>

<p>“I think you have too much regard for your own
good to do otherwise,” answered the detective, without
looking up from the letter he was reading.</p>

<h2 id="XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />
<small>A LOVELY SCRAP.</small></h2>


<p>For half an hour after the departure of Andrew
Lampton, the detective sat at his table, reading letters
and other papers, and occasionally making notes for
answers to be returned or business to be done. He
was a very busy man, and he was essentially methodical.
Efficiency was his watchword, as it is that of
most successful men.</p>

<p>“If I can get hold of this Potter, it won’t be long
before I shall be able to trace Howard Milmarsh. It
is absurd for a young man to remain out of his home
and birthright for a mere idea. That Howard is somewhere
in New York I am convinced. I am inclined
to think this fellow Lampton knows also. If I were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sure of it, he never would have left my house to-night.
As it is, I must have patience.”</p>

<p>He lighted a cigar and smoked reflectively for ten
minutes. Then, suddenly, there was a sharp tap at his
door, and Chick came in, followed by Patsy Garvan.
The faces of both indicated that they had news.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ve found T. Burton Potter!” cried
Chick. “Although I never expected to see him settle
down seriously to work.”</p>

<p>“What’s he working at?”</p>

<p>“He’s doing some kind of clerical work in Partrom’s
steel works, in Harlem.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Quite. I saw him in the yard, moving about among
the men. He was in a business suit, but he didn’t
seem afraid to get his hands dirty. I saw him lifting
some black timbers out of the way when he wanted to
get to another part of the yard, and he helped some
men to shove a truck along the rails when it got
stalled.”</p>

<p>“Well, Potter is a well-built, powerful fellow,” observed
Nick. “And we know he can jump. The way
he went across that alley on the roofs would have
stamped him an athlete without anything else.”</p>

<p>“He’ll need to be an athlete up there at Partrom’s,”
put in Patsy. “I heard that a lot of the men are down
on a certain foreman up there, and that Potter is taking
his side against the others. That generally means
a fight with a rough set of men like those at Partrom’s.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Potter works only in the daytime?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“No. He’s on the night shift. You could get at
him right now if you wanted to go up there.”</p>

<p>“I do want to go up there, and now,” interrupted
the chief. “We’ll use the big car. Telephone the
chauffeur to bring it around right away.”</p>

<p>While Patsy telephoned the chauffeur to come around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
with the big racing car that Nick used when he was
in a great hurry to get anywhere, the detective put
away his papers and got up, ready to go.</p>

<p>He wore the cap he had on when he went to the
café after Andrew Lampton, but not the raincoat. He
had given Lampton back his pistol, but he had his own
in his pocket, although he did not expect to have to
use it. But, then, he never did expect to use a weapon
when he went out. If there were a fight, it was pretty
sure to start up all in a hurry, without preliminaries.</p>

<p>The big car took them up to within four blocks of
Partrom’s big steel mill and then Nick told his assistants
to get out and walk the remainder of the distance
with him.</p>

<p>“Stay here till we come back,” he directed his chauffeur.</p>

<p>It did not take the three long to get to the front
gates of the mill. When they reached there, they
found a lively scene, that none of them had anticipated.
The yard was full of fighting men.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” asked Chick of the nearest
man, who seemed to be trying to break into the row
without knowing just whom to hit. “Who’s fighting?”</p>

<p>“Everybody!” howled the man. “It’s that guy, Gordon,
who’s got the thing going. He and Douglas.”</p>

<p>Nick remembered that Milmarsh had assumed the
name of Robert Gordon when working in the lumber
woods at Maple, and he recalled also that there
had been a foreman named Douglas out there. He
wondered whether this was merely a coincidence, or
whether it had some special significance.</p>

<p>There was no time for speculation on anything,
however. The detective could see that about a dozen
men were aiming at one young fellow, who, broad-shouldered
and active as he was, found it difficult to
stand off all his assailants at once.</p>

<p>The young man backed away from the crowd—not
in haste or with any show of fear, however. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
came nearer to Carter and his two assistants, they
were able to see his face in the red glow of the mill.</p>

<p>“T. Burton Potter!” cried Chick.</p>

<p>“That’s who it is!” agreed Patsy.</p>

<p>“Howard Milmarsh or his wraith!” breathed Nick.</p>

<p>Until now he had been a little doubtful as to the
identity of T. Burton Potter, although his mind was
pretty nearly made up. But he felt sure that this
clean-limbed young man, who used his fists so scientifically,
could not be any one but the heir to the Milmarsh
fortune.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys!” cried Nick to his two assistants.
“We’ll have to take a hand in this.”</p>

<p>Bob Gordon, as he chose to call himself, was holding
back his foes with considerable skill and pluck,
but one pair of fists, no matter how well they are employed,
cannot do much good against twenty pairs.</p>

<p>The men opposing him did not care much about fair
play. All they wanted was to beat down this bold
young man, who set at defiance the whole crowd, and
defended the name of the absent foreman, Douglas,
with a courage worthy of one with eight generations
of American blood in his veins.</p>

<p>Some of the men were trying to pin down Gordon’s
arms so that he would have no driving room,
while some of the others, reaching over, struck viciously
at his head with their fists, knowing he could
not reach them when hemmed in so thoroughly.</p>

<p>“They’ll be taking iron bars to him after a while,
I guess, chief!” remarked Patsy. “Let’s get into this!”</p>

<p>Nick was already into it. A finished boxer, the
detective bestowed a scientific tap here and there on
the faces and necks of those who were crowding Gordon,
thus compelling them to give him breathing room.</p>

<p>At this moment, Chick caught a mean-looking fellow
trying to sneak in an uppercut on Gordon’s undefended
face, while he was busy with half a dozen
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll just hand you this!” observed Chick.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he sent a good, hard crack to the
sneak’s chin, doubling him up like a jackknife, and
sending him backward at full length. Chick’s jab had
been a “rock me to sleep,” as Patsy expressed it.</p>

<p>“Keep back, some of you!” shouted Nick in a tone of
thunder. “Twenty against one! Aren’t you men?
You can’t be Americans, or you wouldn’t act like
cowards!”</p>

<p>His taunt may have shamed one or two of the better
sort. But, as a matter of fact, there were very
few Americans in the mob. The effect of this speech
was to bring half a dozen of the big fellows—ironworkers,
and, therefore, powerful—against the detective.</p>

<p>These men had a rough idea of how to use their
fists, and they pressed hard against Nick, who had
to bring all his skill into play to defend himself. It
was a lively battle, and the shouts of boys, girls, and
men and women outside, together with the squeal of
a police whistle, helped to make it more so.</p>

<p>Bob Gordon might have backed out now and got
away if he had chosen to do so. He had a sprained
wrist, and his wind had been mostly knocked out of
him. But he came up to the side of Nick, anyhow.</p>

<p>Chick and Patsy were both fighting like heroes.
But the weight of numbers was beginning to tell.
There were too many for these four, especially with
one of them practically disabled. It began to look
dubious for Nick’s side.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that a tall, rawboned man
of about thirty, in a blue sweater, who had been driving
past the gateway on a truck, saw what was going
on inside the yard, and decided that it was the place
for him to break in.</p>

<p>He swung off his truck and hurled himself through
the gateway as if he had been sent for. He was a
big, two-fisted truckman, with a natural love of fighting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
which had had plenty of encouragement in many
a combat with other truckmen, and with rough-and-tumble
battlers among longshoremen on the various
water fronts.</p>

<p>“Come on, you dubs!” he bellowed. “Catch ’em
as I hand ’em out. Take ’em anywhere you like—on
your chin, in your eye, on the nose, or anywhere.
They’re all free, and every one is warranted full
weight and hundred per cent the real thing!”</p>

<p>Evidently overjoyed at the prospect of a scrap that
might last for an hour, the big truckman, whose arms
were long and his fists like wooden mallets, ranged
himself alongside Nick and his forces, and soon turned
the tide of battle.</p>

<p>Five minutes later it looked like a regular rout for
the enemy.</p>

<p>But, just as the big truckman was beginning really
to enjoy himself, the police arrived in force, and Nick
whispered to Chick to “Get Patsy and come along. I
don’t want to have to explain to the police now.
Where’s that man Gordon?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s gone,” replied Chick. “I didn’t
see him get away, but that’s what he’s done.”</p>

<p>“Too bad!” exclaimed the chief, allowing his chagrin
to have voice for once. “We had him right here,
and now he’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, it was a lovely scrap!” chuckled
Patsy, tenderly feeling a bump over his left eye. “Did
you see who that truckman was? It was Bonesy Billings,
who used to be a butcher in Fourth Avenue,
and who always brought your meat. I guess he recognized
you, and that’s what brought him into the
fight.”</p>

<p>“It was not only that,” added Chick. “I heard him
say that Gordon roomed at his house, and that he’d
lick anybody who touched a roomer of his.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where Bonesy Billings lives?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. But I’ll bet I can find out,” replied Patsy.
“Bonesy has driven away now, or I’d ask him.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he lives in this neighborhood—as I suppose
he does—we ought to get track of him. Look
him up to-morrow, Patsy, and we’ll call on him in
the evening. He may hold the key to the mystery
we are trying to probe.”</p>

<p>“You mean the finding of Howard Milmarsh?”
asked Chick.</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly,” replied the chief. “I am tired
of this fooling. I want the case off my hands. Come
along! Let’s get home.”</p>

<br />
<small>A WELL OF FIRE.</small></h2>


<p>“So you are living in this brick house, and running
the delicatessen store as well?” said Nick the next
evening, as he and his two assistants stood outside
Bonesy Billings’ home. “This is better than being
in a flat house downtown.”</p>

<p>“You bet it is,” assented Bonesy. “Besides, my
work is up here in this section, and I’ve no reason to
go downtown to live. There’s plenty of these old
brick houses up here that can be rented for about
what you’d pay for a flat around Ninety-seventh
Street, and it’s much more airy and nice here. Then
we have some roomers, that help out.”</p>

<p>“Who are they? Anybody I know, I wonder?”
ventured Nick.</p>

<p>“Not likely. There’s a musician and his daughter—a
nice young girl, and I have another one—that
fellow the gang was trying to do up at Partrom’s
last night. His name’s Gordon.”</p>

<p>“All!” remarked Carter, trying to be calm. “I’d
like to see him again.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you can. I think he’s up in his room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
now. He isn’t working to-night. The superintendent
of the mill has laid him off until inquiries are made
into that fuss where you took a hand. It’s a rotten
shame! Gordon wasn’t to blame for that. The others
jumped on him, and he had to hold ’em off. He’s
told me often that nothing can make him fight—and
he ain’t no coward, either.”</p>

<p>“Look, chief. What’s that?” shouted Patsy Garvan
excitedly, running toward the house. “Fire!”</p>

<p>“Heaven save us!” ejaculated Billings wildly. “It’s
my house!”</p>

<p>He dashed into the store, and through to the back
room, where he saw at once what had happened. His
wife had put kerosene on the kitchen range, and there
had been an explosion which meant destruction for
the house.</p>

<p>Billings lifted his unconscious wife from the floor
and ran out to the street. Then he went back to save
what few pieces of furniture he might hope to get
back before the fire took everything its own way.</p>

<p>The only hope lay in the fact that it was a brick
structure, and not a frame one. The house had been
built after the fire laws had forbidden the putting
up of wooden buildings in that area. But there had
been many brick houses put up before the era of iron-frame
skyscrapers, and this was one of them.</p>

<p>An alarm had been turned in, and already members
of the fire department were dashing up with their
machines. It looked as if the fire would soon be overcome,
when somebody shouted:</p>

<p>“Look! There’s somebody up top!”</p>

<p>The firemen, with their ladders, had already rescued
a woman and two children from another window.
But these people who were shouting for help from an
attic were in the next house, which also had caught
fire.</p>

<p>The firemen—efficient and cool-nerved, as all New
York firemen are—put their ladders up. But owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to the formation of the house, it was impossible to
get at the attic quickly.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had seen that it was a young girl at
the window, and his wonderful memory carried him
back to that night at Maple, where he had seen the
girl they called Bessie Silvius, with her father, Roscoe
Silvius, who had played and sung in the garden of
the Savoy.</p>

<p>“That only confirms my belief that Howard Milmarsh
is here,” he told himself. “It would be likely
for them to live in the same house in New York if
they could, after being friends in the wilds of Canada.”</p>

<p>This passed his mind like a flash as he looked
to see how they might be rescued. He had seen that
the firemen could not do it from the outside, and he
made up his mind to a desperate undertaking.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Nick was known to all the battalion
chiefs of the fire department, and to most of the other
men. They all recognized him as a wonderful detective,
and he was allowed privileges that ordinary citizens
do not possess, even though they may have influence
and great wealth.</p>

<p>It is not an easy thing to get inside the fire lines
and be permitted to move about freely—unless you
happen to be a newspaper man.</p>

<p>“Keep back, Patsy!” shouted Nick, as he dashed into
the house, amid a shower of sparks and through a
flood of water pouring from two or three lines of
hose. “I’m going alone!”</p>

<p>“Come back!” bellowed a battalion chief. “You
can’t get through there!”</p>

<p>Patsy and Chick would both have followed their
chief, but firemen held them back, and they were
obliged to yield.</p>

<p>As they looked up, they saw a man lean from the
attic window of Billings’ house and Patsy yelled that
it was Potter.</p>

<p>“It’s either Potter or Howard Milmarsh,” called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
out Chick. “I don’t know one from the other these
days.”</p>

<p>“He’s going to try and save that girl!” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“Sure enough!” assented Chick. “But where’s the
chief?” he added, in a tone of agony. “That’s what
he went into that house for. I wish we’d never heard
of this Milmarsh case!”</p>

<p>“Come down out of that attic!” roared a chief
through his megaphone at Potter or Milmarsh, whichever
it was. “You can’t reach the girl. Hurry down,
and you may save yourself. Another moment will
be too late!”</p>

<p>But the man at the attic window paid no heed. His
eyes were on the girl, who still leaned from the other
window, and who was uttering scream after scream
of despairing terror.</p>

<p>The roar of the fire, the hissing of the water, and
the thud of the fire engines all made up a deafening
confusion of sounds. But, through it all, Chick heard
the man at the other window call out cheerfully:</p>

<p>“Don’t give way, Bessie! I’m coming to save you
by the roof!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Howard! Howard!” responded the girl, shrill
with horror. “My father is here, and he’s helpless!”</p>

<p>“Keep up your heart!” responded the man. “I’m
coming!”</p>

<p>“Say, Patsy, she called him ‘Howard.’ Did you
hear it?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“Then that looks as if he is the real thing, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>But Patsy did not reply. He was wondering
whether the man would reappear. He had vanished
from the window, and he might have fallen back, exhausted,
into the awful caldron of flame and smoke
behind him.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get a ladder up there!” cried a fire
chief. “Up with her, boys! The third house is on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
fire now. We must get this fellow out somehow.
There’s a better chance with the ladder at this house
than either of the others.”</p>

<p>It was Bonesy Billings’ house in which the young
man called “Howard” by the girl had just disappeared
from the attic window. It was not burning so fiercely
as the other two.</p>

<p>Whether the firemen succeeded in getting the ladder
to the window where the young man was believed
to be, neither Chick nor Patsy could see for the smoke.
Besides, their attention was distracted from it in their
anxiety for their beloved chief.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nick was bounding, head down, up the
flaming stairs. As he reached—barely reached—the
landing of the second floor, the whole staircase collapsed
behind him. As it did so, it sent a great gush
of flame and burning embers far upward and out of
the front door. Several firemen, who had been trying
to follow him, tumbled out, half suffocated, into
the arms of their comrades outside!</p>

<p>Nick glanced over his shoulder as he heard the crash.
He saw the well of fire where the stairs had been, and
he knew that death in its most appalling form had
missed him by only a few inches!</p>

<p>He pressed on still upward, with smoke and sparks
around him, and death—almost certain, as it seemed—ahead!</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>




<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="XX">CHAPTER XX.
<br />
<small>FIVE SECONDS FROM DEATH.</small></h2>


<p>Somehow—he never knew how—Nick found his
way to the top of the house. Here he was obliged to
pause for a moment. His heart was pounding and his
breath came short. Some little rest he <em>must</em> have!</p>

<p>“Hello! There’s something thudding overhead!”
he gasped. “By Heaven! It is somebody trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
break through that trapdoor in the roof! It may be
some of the firemen!” he added hopefully. “That
means that we shall get the girl and the others yet.
Hurrah for the firemen of New York!”</p>

<p>A door was burst open on his right and a girl rushed
forth, wild with excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh, Howard!” she cried. “I’m so thankful you
are here! Quick! Quick! My father!”</p>

<p>Then, in the gloom and lurid glare of the fire, she
found she was talking to a stranger, and she hesitated
to say more.</p>

<p>But Nick Carter quickly reassured her, and his
cheery tones acted like a stimulant, as he called out:</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, and be ready! Leave your father
to me! We must get out by the roof. There is no
other way. The firemen are up there. They’ll soon
break through with their axes. Don’t you hear them
hammering on the trapdoor?”</p>

<p>“No,” she cried. “It isn’t the firemen. It’s Howard—Mr.
Milmarsh! He can’t open that trap! Oh,
can’t we help? Can’t we do something?”</p>

<p>The name Milmarsh was spoken by this girl as if
he were a close friend! It struck the detective with
peculiar force, and he resolved more than ever that
the young man, as well as the girl, must be saved.
Here was the end of his strange case, if only he could
get every one clear of the fire!</p>

<p>But other things soon crowded these thoughts out
of his mind—which, indeed, they had held only for
a second or two. He rushed into the attic and seized
a small pine table. This made a platform for him
under the trapdoor, and enabled him to reach up and
shoot back the bolt.</p>

<p>“It’s open!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Then he pushed his head through and found himself
looking into the face of—either T. Burton Potter
or Howard Milmarsh, he did not know which, for
certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The grime on the detective’s face had changed it
so completely that he was not surprised that there
was no recognition in the eyes of the man looking
down at him. Indeed, the man did not see him. He
only peered past him into the gloom, where the girl
stood.</p>

<p>“Where is your father, Bessie?” he asked. “I’m
coming down.”</p>

<p>“No, stay where you are!” interposed Nick. “You
can be more helpful up there. I’ll bring her father.”</p>

<p>Old Roscoe Silvius, haggard from illness, sat up
on a bed in the adjoining room. Nick wrapped him
in a blanket and had him out before the old man knew
what was happening.</p>

<p>It was not an easy task to lift the helpless old man
through the trap. But Howard Milmarsh helped from
above, and it was accomplished in less time than might
have been expected.</p>

<p>“Now, you!” cried the detective to the girl. “I’ll
lift you.”</p>

<p>Bessie Silvius helped herself a great deal, and in
a moment was on the roof, by the side of her father
and Howard Milmarsh—as, for convenience, we will
continue to call the young man.</p>

<p>Nick followed the girl with one active spring, and,
standing upright on the roof, looked around. One
glance was enough to show him that their only hope
of escape lay in crossing the roof of the next house,
and so reaching a place where they might descend to
the street.</p>

<p>The next house was the one which had suffered
most by the fire, and the roof looked as if it might
fall in at any moment. Therein lay most of their
peril.</p>

<p>“Go ahead with the young lady,” directed the detective,
as Howard looked at him inquiringly. “I will
bring her father. Push on!”</p>

<p>Howard drew the girl away, and Nick lifted the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
man, carrying him on a stalwart shoulder along the
shaky roof. Fortunately, the roof was flat, and there
was only a low parapet dividing it from the next house,
one that it was easy to step over.</p>

<p>It was here that the real peril began, however. The
house was a mere blazing shell. In many places the
roof had burned through, revealing fire and blazing
rafters below in the awful hell-like pit.</p>

<p>At every step there was danger of a plunge into
the abyss of death below. But, with the luck that
often attends daring and desperation, they reached the
third house in safety.</p>

<p>“We shall have to climb down the front,” said Nick.
“The firemen ought to have a ladder there by this time.
But there’s a sloping roof to be negotiated. We must
be very careful, or it will send us headlong to the
street, after all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go first,” offered Howard.</p>

<p>Before Nick could object—if he had intended to
do so—Howard Milmarsh had crawled up the steep
and slippery slate roof, and was holding to the ridgepole.</p>

<p>Reaching down, he took Bessie Silvius’ hand and
pulled her up to the ridge, so that she could slide down
the other side of the flat part of the roof.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment!” called Howard to the detective.
“I’ll come back and help you!”</p>

<p>“No! You and the young lady get to the ground
as soon as you can. I do not need any help. But
this roof is getting worse every minute. There is no
time for argument.”</p>

<p>This was obvious. The slates were splitting off
in the growing heat, and the rafters below were burning
fiercely. It would be only a question of seconds
when everything would tumble in at once.</p>

<p>Having seen that Howard and the girl had obeyed
him, Nick then attacked the fearsome task of climbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the roof with the weight of the old musician, and
getting down the other side.</p>

<p>He accomplished the feat, and then saw that Howard
Milmarsh was on the ladder at the top, ready to
help him. The girl had already been carried or had
climbed herself to the ground and safety.</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried Carter to Howard. “Go down!
I can manage. The ladder won’t bear three of us.”</p>

<p>It called for all the iron nerve possessed by the detective
to crawl across the remainder of the roof, carrying
the dead weight of Roscoe Silvius, and it was
a ticklish thing to work his way over the edge of the
building to the ladder. One false step would have
hurled both headlong down.</p>

<p>But that false step was never taken. The detective
seldom made anything of the kind at any time.
There was no fireman at the top of the ladder to assist
him by relieving him of his burden.</p>

<p>He knew that was because Milmarsh had not yet
reached the bottom, but he could not afford to wait.
The entire roof was likely to collapse at any instant.</p>

<p>Slowly he began to descend. As he placed his foot
on the third rung from the top, he heard the ladder
crack loudly about halfway down.</p>

<p>“Quick!” came the shout from below. “The ladder’s
sprung! Slide down! It’s your only chance!”</p>

<p>But that was just what Nick, having only one hand
free, could not do. He kept on moving downward
as fast as he could, step by step. There was nothing
else to be done.</p>

<p>It was a period of breathless suspense. There were
no more cries from below. The great crowd was
watching this one man fighting death to save another,
and they felt instinctively that any unnecessary noise
might disturb him.</p>

<p>Suddenly one broad-shouldered young man rushed
out from the throng held back by a cordon of police.
It was Chick!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Dodging the police and firemen who tried to stop
him, he gained the foot of the ladder and went swarming
up like a monkey.</p>

<p>Almost immediately he was standing just below
Carter, and speaking to him with the coolness that was
characteristic of both of them in moments of fierce
peril.</p>

<p>Just as Chick got there the ladder began to sag in
the middle!</p>

<p>“Drop him on my shoulder, chief!”</p>

<p>“All right! Glad you’re here!”</p>

<p>Carefully, but not too fast, the weight of the old
man was transferred to Chick’s arm and shoulder.</p>

<p>“I have him!” announced Chick. “I’ll have to
walk down with him. But you slide! Just wait till
I’m nearly down. Then come!”</p>

<p>Chick had already begun to move while he spoke,
and he was at the bottom in such a short time that
his feat would have done credit to any old sailor of
the ancient windjammer days.</p>

<p>Nick was not far behind him. He walked down
the rungs till a shout told him his assistant was off
the ladder. Then, gripping the sides, he slid down like
a streak.</p>

<p>He had not a fraction of a second to spare! The
ladder cracked in the middle just as he passed the weak
place. He had to drop a few feet, as it was.</p>

<p>“Get back there!” roared the fire chief, through his
megaphone.</p>

<p>The warning was none too soon. As the crowd
sprang away, the roof and upper walls of the middle
house fell with a crash, and a great volcano of smoke,
sparks, and dust flew up into the air.</p>

<p>Some of the débris fell among the crowd. It could
not be otherwise. Cries of fright and pain arose here
and there, and there was danger of a panic.</p>

<p>But the police were efficient—as New York police
always are—and soon there was comparative order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
as those who were injured were carried away in the
ambulances which had been waiting on the chance that
they might be needed.</p>

<p>Neither Nick Carter, Chick, nor Patsy Garvan were
hurt. The girl and her father had disappeared, but
the detective felt sure they were being cared for by
somebody, and it did not worry him. What he wanted
was to find the man he had been hunting so long,
Howard Milmarsh.</p>

<p>Chick and Patsy both knew what was passing in
the mind of their chief, and they, too, were looking
about for Milmarsh.</p>

<p>“There he is!” shouted Patsy. “I wonder if he’s
hurt!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter wondered this, too, as he saw Howard
Milmarsh leaning on the iron fence of a house a little
distance away, across the street, with his head resting
on his hand.</p>

<p>“It didn’t get you, did it?” asked Nick, hurrying
over to him.</p>

<p>“No. I’m all right! A little shaken, that’s all. But
we saved Bessie! That’s the main point!”</p>

<p>“Hum!” grunted Patsy significantly. “When a fellow’s
stuck on a girl, he don’t care for much else—eh,
Chick?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it,” grinned Chick,
who felt happy over the way everything had turned
out. “What do I know about girls?”</p>

<p>Nick slipped an arm around Howard Milmarsh’s
shoulder, and there was sympathy in his strong, smoke-begrimed
face, which drew forth response from the
other at once.</p>

<p>“A brick struck me on the head,” he said, with an
involuntary groan. “It hurt my head. But it’s nothing
serious.”</p>

<p>“You need rest and quiet for a while, and I’ll see
that you get it. Come with me.”</p>

<p>Howard Milmarsh was willing to accept anybody’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
kindly ministrations now. The reaction had come,
and he felt as weak as a little child. Without answering,
he suffered himself to be led away, Carter on
one side of him, and Chick on the other, while Patsy
ran ahead to see that the chauffeur was there with
the big motor car.</p>

<p>When they had lifted the now half-fainting young
man into the car and disposed him comfortably with
the rugs that were always in the car, Chick and Patsy
got in with him.</p>

<p>Nick took his place by the side of the chauffeur.
As the car started, on its way to the detective’s home,
Nick tried to compose his mind and comprehend the
strange happenings that had brought to him the heir
to the Milmarsh millions.</p>

<p>“‘There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, rough
hew them how we will,’” he quoted softly to himself.</p>

<br />
<small>ANOTHER KINK.</small></h2>


<p>Although Howard Milmarsh had declared that he
was not much hurt, and soon would be well again,
it was found that his injuries were more serious than
either he or Nick Carter had believed at first.</p>

<p>The patient was kept at Nick’s home that night,
and the detective’s own physician, the famous Doctor
Grant, came in. He gave the sick man a long
examination. Then, after prescribing a sedative, he
beckoned Nick one side, for a private report.</p>

<p>“The truth is, Carter, his mind has gone.”</p>

<p>The detective started and a look of genuine horror
appeared in his face.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that he is permanently insane?”</p>

<p>“No. I wouldn’t say that. But the blow on the
head, with the excitement and mental strain, have
been too much for his brain. It has produced a condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of aphasia, or loss of memory, which makes him
unable to talk in a coherent manner, simply because
he can’t think.”</p>

<p>“I understand. But I hope he will soon recover.”</p>

<p>Doctor Grant shrugged his shoulders. As a physician,
he was more interested in the case from a scientific
point of view than anything else. At the same
time, he was not wanting in sympathy.</p>

<p>“My advice is to have him removed to a hospital,
where he will be under constant supervision and will
have proper care. You can put him in a private room—that
is, if you do not mind the expense——”</p>

<p>“The expense is nothing,” interrupted the detective
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Very well. Then that is what you’d better do.
In time, with quiet and careful nursing, together with
medical attention, he will come around, I have no
doubt. I will see him every day. I’m on the staff
of the Universal Hospital—where I should advise
you to send him—and I will put him on my regular
list.”</p>

<p>An ambulance conveyed the patient to the Universal
Hospital, and he was put to bed in one of the best
private rooms. Special nurses were engaged for him—one
day nurse and one for the night—and orders
given that he be not left alone for an instant.</p>

<p>Having done this, the detective could only wait,
although it worried him to think that, now that he
had found the missing heir, it was only to see him
physically unable to take possession of his rights.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are sure this is the real, genuine
Howard Milmarsh, eh?” suggested Chick, the evening
that they had had the sick, and still partly unconscious,
young man taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>“I am not sure of anything,” returned his chief,
lighting a perfecto. “But if he isn’t, then I am worse
fooled than I am generally in a matter of identity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>A tap at the door, and the butler entered, to announce
“Mr. Andrew Lampton!”</p>

<p>“Show him in.”</p>

<p>Lampton came in with rather a jaunty step, bowed
to Carter and glanced questioningly in the direction of
his companion.</p>

<p>“You can say what you have to say, Lampton,”
was Nick’s reply to this silent query. “This is Chick
Carter, and he is my confidential assistant. Take a
chair.”</p>

<p>Andrew Lampton seated himself slowly, at the
same time keeping his eyes fixed on the detective,
while a cynical smile played about his lips.</p>

<p>“Where is T. Burton Potter?” asked Nick, handing
a cigar box to his visitor. “You have not brought
him with you?”</p>

<p>Andrew Lampton took a perfecto from the box, and
accepted a light before he answered. Then he said
calmly:</p>

<p>“I have not brought him with me, because he is
in the Universal Hospital. He was badly hurt at a
fire last night, I have been told, and has been removed
to the hospital, where it is expected he will not recover.”</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that Nick maintained his usual
calm exterior. Here was an assertion that he could
not disprove while the patient at the Universal Hospital
was unable to speak for himself. True, the girl,
Bessie Silvius, had called him Howard Milmarsh. But
if T. Burton Potter were slick enough to deceive
others, why should he not have fooled the girl also?</p>

<p>These thoughts ran like lightning through the detective’s
brain, as he and Andrew Lampton both
smoked steadily. The former was staring at a picture
on the opposite side of the room, as if his mind
were quite occupied with it, to the exclusion of everything
else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“What makes you think the man in the hospital is
T. Burton Potter?” he inquired, at last.</p>

<p>“Well, I was told by Louden Powers that he lived
in that house, and that he had been accepted by some
of Milmarsh’s intimate friends as Milmarsh, and that
he had been injured at last night’s fire.”</p>

<p>“You know I was at that fire?” asked Nick quietly.</p>

<p>“Naturally. Everybody knows that.”</p>

<p>“How does everybody know it?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you seen the evening papers?”</p>

<p>“No. I saw the morning papers, and my name did
not appear in them. I requested that it should not.
Also, I asked that Howard Milmarsh’s name be kept
out of the account of the fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, here is an evening paper,” returned Lampton,
handing him one. “It is evident that the news
leaked. I don’t mind saying, however, that Louden
Powers and I were both at that fire, and that we saw
you come down the ladder with that old man. Somebody
else—the gentleman over there, whom you tell
me is your assistant—carried him down the lower
part of the ladder. Then you slid down by yourself.”</p>

<p>Nick glanced down the column of print detailing
the incidents of the fire, and saw that his own name
and Howard Milmarsh’s were both mentioned. He
had little doubt that the “leak” had been contrived
by Louden Powers and Andrew Lampton. But he
did not say so. It was his custom to let the other
party play his hand out before he showed his own,
if it could be done.</p>

<p>“How long had T. Burton Potter been living in that
house where the fire was?” he asked, at last.</p>

<p>“Only a few days, I understand. That’s what the
man who rents the house tells me. He is a truckman,
and his name is said to be Billings. They call him
Bonesy Billings, but I should think the ‘Bonesy’ is
only a nickname. At all events, that is the only first
name I heard for him. He calls his roomer Howard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Milmarsh. But that only shows how much alike Potter
and this Milmarsh must be; when nobody can tell
which is which. You haven’t heard anything of the
real Milmarsh, have you?”</p>

<p>“I think I have,” was Nick’s curt reply.</p>

<p>He had to admit to himself that Andrew Lampton
and Louden Powers were playing a cunning game.
They had taken instant advantage of the sickness of
the man hurt at the fire to declare that he was T. Burton
Potter, and not Howard Milmarsh. And the
worst of it was that it could not be disproved unless
the poor fellow whose memory was gone could be
brought to his senses.</p>

<p>“Where is Louden Powers?”</p>

<p>This question came suddenly, but it did not disturb
Lampton. He puffed contentedly at the good
cigar between his lips, and answered briefly:</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You saw him last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But that is the last time I saw him. Louden
said he had a little business to attend to, which
would keep him out of New York for a few days.
Then he hopped on a street car and was gone. Mighty
slick citizen, Louden!”</p>

<p>“What is to prevent my putting you in the Tombs
while I look into this matter?” suddenly demanded
Nick.</p>

<p>Chick, who had been sitting at his desk in a corner
of the room, jumped to his feet as his chief
abruptly flung the question at Lampton. Chick was
as much surprised as anybody—more so than Lampton
appeared to be, for that worthy did not move in
his chair, and took the time to inhale a few more puffs
of his cigar, before he answered coolly:</p>

<p>“Your word, my dear boy! You promised me you
would not do anything of that kind so long as I did
what you requested. Well, I’ve done it. You wanted
me to bring T. Burton Potter to you, and you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
him in your own care. He is in the hospital, it is
true. But he’s under your own eye, and you might
not have had him if I had chosen to get him away
before the fire broke out. I could have done it easily,
but I was pledged to you, and, of course, I could not
go back on you. I know you will keep faith with me.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” admitted the detective. “It would
be better if I had you securely in a cell. But I won’t
do it at present.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!”</p>

<p>“I do not concede that you had anything to do with
putting T. Burton Potter into my hands—if the young
man in the hospital really is Potter—but I will allow
you to have your own way about that.”</p>

<p>“It is the truth. That’s why. You know it, too,
Mr. Carter. Well, if there is nothing else, I reckon
I’ll be going. If you want me again, you can hear of
me at the café in Third Avenue, where you found me
before. So long!”</p>

<p>With the remnant of the perfecto sticking up from
the corner of his mouth, Andrew Lampton strolled
to the door, opened it, and disappeared. As the door
closed, Chick remarked casually:</p>

<p>“Patsy will see where he goes. I’ve given him a
standing order not to lose sight of Andrew Lampton
when once he has been here.”</p>

<p>“Quite right!” commended the chief. “Now we
have a lot of our work to do all over again! I believed
I really had Howard Milmarsh and could close
up the case. But these rascals have started a new game,
and we shall have to see it through.”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe it is really T. Burton Potter
who is in the hospital, do you?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“I shall have to prove it isn’t. That’s the task they
have set for me, and it will not be an easy one.”</p>

<br />
<small>ANOTHER SCHEME.</small></h2>


<p>The weeks went slowly by, and the patient in the
private room at the Universal Hospital remained in
the bewildered condition in which he had been since
the night of the fire. He improved physically, but
his mind was still a blank.</p>

<p>“Have you seen this, chief?” asked Chick one morning,
as, after breakfast, he opened the morning paper,
which Carter had been too busy to look at yet. “Another
scheme to open up a beautiful section in Muddyford
or Eden-in-the-Swamp. It’s an advertisement,
and it reads like a romance. Listen!”</p>

<p>He read the principal display lines in a full-page
advertisement, as follows:</p>

<p>“‘The new Paradise City! Artistic Homes for
Everybody, which are paid for the same as rent. A
bower in the midst of nature’s loveliness.’ And so on.
Get on to that old gag, chief, ‘Paid for the same as
rent?’ That’s a lulu.”</p>

<p>“Advertisements of that kind are always in the papers,”
remarked Nick carelessly. “Some of those
real-estate developments are all right, too. Others
are not, of course.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about this one,” went on
his assistant. “But I couldn’t help noticing it, because
it’s the same one we’ve been getting booklets
about. Here’s one that was in the mail box yesterday.
It was just shoved through the slit by hand.
That’s what makes it look fishy. As if they were afraid
to use the mails, in case of government inquiries.”</p>

<p>“You may be wrong about that, Chick,” answered
his employer absently, as he lighted his after-breakfast
cigar. “What’s the booklet about?”</p>

<p>“Well, the heading looks as if it might possibly interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
us. It reads: ‘The Lost Heir Found! The
Story of a Great Estate to be Given to the Use and
Benefit of Everybody.’”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Nick, suddenly interested.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a lot in it about a long-lost heir having
suddenly returned and claimed his own. He has
traveled far during his years of absence, and, while
away, he has made a deep study of country homes
for the masses at a low cost. It is a hobby with him.”</p>

<p>“Go on. Are you reading from the book?”</p>

<p>“I am picking out the important parts,” returned
Chick. “Do you want to see it? Here it is.”</p>

<p>He handed the gaudy-covered pamphlet to his chief,
who rapidly absorbed the salient points of its contents.
He had the faculty of skimming pages and getting
their purport in a few hasty glances.</p>

<p>One paragraph that particularly interested him explained
things in these rather bombastic terms:</p>

<p>“The long-lost heir of this estate—which is within
a few miles of New York City—has resolved that
some of the broad acres which have now become his
shall be surrendered to the people. Upon these acres
he will build a model settlement, a city of beautiful
homes, each set in a fair garden of its own. To these
he invites those who have heretofore been cooped up
in city flats to come and live, really, in the lap of
bounteous nature. Come to the new Paradise City
and see for yourselves.”</p>

<p>The exact situation of the new Paradise City was
not given. Those who were interested could call at
room No. 2006 in one of the great skyscraping office
buildings downtown, and there learn all they might
wish to know. It was also stated that a small sum
down would be required. After that the property
could be paid for in monthly payments.</p>

<p>“There is nothing remarkable about this,” remarked
Nick, “except about the long-lost heir. That gives me
a feeling that it may be the Milmarsh estate somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
is playing with. I don’t see how it is, exactly, unless
some one has seen the attorneys, Johnson, Robertson
&amp; Judkins, and persuaded them that Howard Milmarsh
has turned up.”</p>

<p>“How can that be?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“Do you know for certain whether it is T. Burton
Potter or Howard Milmarsh lying in that room at the
Universal Hospital?”</p>

<p>Nick put this query significantly, and Chick immediately
screwed up one eye.</p>

<p>“We might call up the lawyers on the telephone
and find out something about it,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“We might. But I prefer to look into it myself.
The lawyers will take what evidence is presented, and
act upon it. They may have done so already. It looks
to me as if they have. If I were to call them up there
would be a lot of bustle immediately, and the scoundrels,
if they really have tried to steal a march on
me, would be on their guard.”</p>

<p>“It’s Lampton, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“And Louden Powers,” added Nick. “I have not
much doubt about that. We’ll go up to room No.
2006 in that building and see what we can find out.”</p>

<p>“What are we to look like?” asked the young man,
quite as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“I’ll be an old man, in shabby clothes. You can be
my son, with spectacles and a cap pulled down low.
That will be disguise enough. They would spot us at
once if we didn’t do something to change our appearance.
I hate to do that kind of thing, but it can’t be
helped in this case.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later a feeble old man, in a long, thin
overcoat and wearing a soft, black hat with a wide
brim, was helped upon a Broadway car by a young
man with dark spectacles and wearing a cap. The
rest of the young fellow’s apparel was a shabby sack
suit and a blue necktie under a frayed collar. His
shoes were of tan leather and badly scuffed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The look of the two suggested that they had a little
money saved, but were the kind of people who were
obliged to watch their nickels carefully.</p>

<p>They found that there were three offices belonging
to the Paradise Improvement Company, although only
one was open to the public. It was a sort of anteroom,
and there were a number of people waiting to
see the big man in the inner office when Nick Carter
and his assistant forced their way in through the
throng.</p>

<p>“Say, chief!” whispered Chick. “There’s Billings!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, Bonesy Billings was there to purchase
a lot at Paradise City. He did not care who heard
him talk about his business. He was telling a chance
acquaintance that his house had caught fire, but that
his furniture was all insured, and he had enough
money now to go and live in the country, to raise
chickens and garden truck and keep a cow. He figured
he could make a fair living that way and
wouldn’t have to work as he had in New York.</p>

<p>“I’d like to warn him to be careful,” remarked
Chick, in a low tone, to his chief. “He’s just the
kind of simple fellow to swallow all that is told him,
and I don’t like the general look of these offices. They
are too gorgeous to be entirely honest, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>Bonesy Billings went into the inner sanctum, and
after about fifteen minutes came out with a quantity
of “literature” in his hands. This consisted of booklets,
circulars, statements of what had been done to improve
the plots to be sold, and plenty of gay-colored
pictures.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to look it over,” announced Bonesy,
to anybody who would listen. “It’s out in the country,
all right, and it’s been a private estate for a hundred
years. But it’s such a big place that the present owners
can afford to have this Paradise City built in one part
of it without its ever being seen from the windows
of the big house. The folks in that mansion will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
neighbors of them that buys in Paradise. I guess I’ll
go up there of evenings and hear the daughter of the
family—if there is one—play the pianner. Good old
ragtime, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Where is the place?” ventured Chick.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a family by the name of Milmarsh,” replied
Bonesy. “Howard Milmarsh, who has been
away for three years or so, is home again, and it’s
him that’s laying out this new place. He’s all right,
Howard is.”</p>

<p>“Is he inside the offices now?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. It’s the manager who does the
business. He’s a lawyer, I was told.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see him,” put in Nick, in a quavering
voice. “I hope I shan’t have to wait long.”</p>

<p>There was a note of appeal in this from the seemingly
old man that touched the hearts of most of the
people waiting to see the manager.</p>

<p>“Let him go in first. I’m willing,” declared a man
who evidently was one who worked hard with his
hands, and who was the next in line. “If everybody
else is agreeable, let the old gentleman go right in.”</p>

<p>There was no dissent, and Chick, taking his chief
by the elbow, propelled him into the inner office.</p>

<p>Three persons were in the room, but none of them
were known to the detective or Chick.</p>

<p>“Too slick to give themselves away,” whispered
the latter, as they entered. “I half expected to see
Louden Powers or Lampton.”</p>

<p>“They are in the background, I guess,” was the
hasty reply.</p>

<p>They advanced into the large room, and Nick bowed
humbly to a portly, dignified man behind the large
table. On either side of him were younger men, who
appeared to be assistants. There was a typewriter
in front of one of them.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to describe the interview in detail.
Suffice it that when Nick and his assistant came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
out of the offices, they had a bundle of circulars and
booklets, and had learned positively that somebody
who called himself Howard Milmarsh had taken possession
of the estate.</p>

<p>One thing rather relieved Nick, and that was the admission
from the big man behind the desk that Mr.
Milmarsh had not formally taken possession of his
property yet. There were some legal matters to be adjusted,
he said, which might take a month or more.
But Mr. Milmarsh was selling plots now, with the
understanding that buildings would begin after the
settlement of his estate.</p>

<p>“It’s a swindle, of course. But it is in the hands
of good lawyers, and they know just how to smooth
over the rough places for their clients,” remarked
Nick. “I should like to see Lampton.”</p>

<p>Little more was said until the two were again at
home. They had not used the street cars this time.
Chick caught a passing taxi, and they rode quickly
home.</p>

<p>“Let Patsy run over to that café and find out something
about Andrew Lampton. I understand he has
lost sight of him in the last three weeks.”</p>

<p>“Well, you did not want him to spend any more
time watching the fellow,” Chick reminded him.</p>

<p>“I know that. We traced him to a hotel uptown,
and he was living there till three weeks ago. Then
he vanished, and I did not think it worth while to
trouble Patsy about it any longer.”</p>

<p>Chick looked at his chief in a peculiar way. He felt
convinced that there was something passing in the
detective’s mind that he had not chosen to divulge.
He was right, as his next words showed.</p>

<p>“I had information that he was in the neighborhood
of the Milmarsh home. Captain Brown is an old
friend of mine. I telephoned him, and he said a
man who did not give his name, but who, he since has
learned, calls himself Powers, stayed at the Old Pike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Inn one night. After that he went up to the Milmarsh
home, and is believed to be the guest of Howard Milmarsh.
If Louden Powers is there, the chances are
that Andrew Lampton is not far away.”</p>

<p>Patsy hastened out on his errand, and in about half
an hour returned with the information that Andrew
Lampton had gone to the country, but that no one
knew what was his destination.</p>

<p>“That will do, Patsy. You will have to remain on
watch here for a few days. Chick and I are going out
to the Old Pike Inn on the midnight train.”</p>

<p>“There’s a train two hours earlier than the ‘Owl,’”
suggested Patsy.</p>

<p>“I know that,” was Nick’s reply. “But I do not
care to reach there while many people are about.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Patsy with a grin. “You want to sneak
in on rubbers.”</p>

<br />
<small>WHICH WAS WHICH?</small></h2>


<p>At eight o’clock the next morning the chief and
Chick faced each other across a well-served breakfast
in a private dining room in the Old Pike Inn, while
Captain Brown, the proprietor, smiled on them from a
chair at the window.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, Carter,” went on Brown, who had
been speaking, “we can’t tell much about this Howard
Milmarsh. I used to see him down here at the Inn
pretty often, and I thought I knew him. He has
changed a little in the few years he has been away.
But the features are the same, of course, and his size
and shape have not much altered. In fact, I thought he
would have grown heavier than he has.”</p>

<p>“Does he come down to the Inn now?”</p>

<p>“Never seen him since the night he arrived, with
that man Andrew Lampton. That was before Louden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Powers came. Powers stayed here one night, but the
other two went straight up to the Milmarsh residence.
I happened to be down at the railroad station when
they arrived, or I wouldn’t have seen them at all.”</p>

<p>“Did you speak to them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Milmarsh shook hands with me, and said
I had not changed since he saw me last, and I handed
him back a similar line of talk. You know how men
do when they haven’t seen each other for a long
time.”</p>

<p>Carter nodded and poured out another cup of coffee
for Chick.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed Captain Brown jovially.
“What humbugs men are! I could see a lot of
changes in him, but I did not think he would want me
to say so, and, of course, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, we came up here to learn what really was
going on,” observed Nick, after a pause. “What are
they doing at Paradise City?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“No building going on?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. They couldn’t build there. It’s that
swampy place over to the northeast. Mr. Milmarsh—I
mean this Howard Milmarsh’s father—never did
anything with it. He talked about having it filled in
some time. But he never did it. If he had, he would
have made it an extension to his golf links.”</p>

<p>“They are selling plots, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do the people who buy the plots think the swamp
won’t hurt?” threw in Chick, as he finished his breakfast.</p>

<p>“They don’t see the swamp,” replied Captain Brown.</p>

<p>“How do they buy, then?”</p>

<p>“From a map. Ha, ha, ha! Swamps don’t show
on maps—unless you want them to. You ought to
know that.”</p>

<p>“I do know it,” replied Chick. “But I didn’t suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
they could put over such a bluff as that. It isn’t
Howard Milmarsh who does it, is it?”</p>

<p>Nick listened with some show of interest for Captain
Brown’s reply to this.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who is at the back of the Paradise
City project,” he answered more seriously. “I suppose
Howard Milmarsh must sanction it, or it wouldn’t
be going on. But the fellows engineering the game
are Louden Powers and Andrew Lampton.”</p>

<p>It was apparent to Nick Carter that Captain Brown
could have told more about the business if he had
chosen to do so. But he was manager of the Old
Pike Inn, and it was his policy not to say anything
about anybody which might rebound and hurt his
trade. He was an innkeeper first of all, and he never
forgot his own interests.</p>

<p>“Well, captain, you will be careful not to let anybody
know who we are, of course?” adjured the detective.
“We shall go and see the swamp during the day,
and to-night there will be something else we shall have
to attend to. Secrecy is important, but I was sure
we could depend on you.”</p>

<p>“You can bank on me to the last cent,” replied Captain
Brown impressively. “You say you want to
look at that swamp?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to walk through it, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Nick, with a smile. “It must be
pretty wet about this time.”</p>

<p>“Almost a lake! What I was about to suggest is
that I can take you along the east road in my car,
and you can see the swamp over the fence. If that is
all you want of it.”</p>

<p>“That will be just what we do want,” replied Nick.
“I should like to assure myself that nothing has been
done to alter the appearance of the place. How soon
do we start?”</p>

<p>“In ten minutes, if you like. I’ll go down and telephone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the garage at once, and have the machine at the
door by the time you are ready. It will be an open
car—unless you would rather ride in a limousine.
You would not be so exposed to view then.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lonely road, and if we do see anybody staring,
we can pull our hats down over our eyes, and be
looking for something that we may have dropped in
the car,” said the chief. “We’ll take the open car.”</p>

<p>Neither Carter nor Chick made any attempt to disguise
themselves for this trip. They appeared merely
to be two visitors to Old Pike Inn looking at the
country as the guests of Captain Brown. He often
took guests out in his car.</p>

<p>Nick knew something about the section of the Milmarsh
estate generally spoken of by those who lived
in the neighborhood as “the swamp.” But he wanted
to look it over, to make sure that it had not been
changed.</p>

<p>He kept in mind the instructions of the elder Howard
Milmarsh, to see that his son was not deprived
of any of his rights.</p>

<p>If this was the real Howard Milmarsh who had
seated himself in the mansion, with these two shady
characters, Louden Powers and Andrew Lampton, as
his chief advisers, then it was the detective’s clear duty
to go there and tell the new head of the Milmarsh
family what his father’s wishes were.</p>

<p>“I shall know more about it after to-night,” was
the way he finally settled it with himself.</p>

<p>The swamp looked about the same as he always had
seen it, and he ground his teeth in indignation as he
thought of the poor people who were giving up their
money for worse than nothing at all.</p>

<p>It was just as they had passed the swamp, and were
turning into another road, away from the Milmarsh
estate, that Nick caught sight of a man walking in a
narrow path not far from the big house, apparently in
deep thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>His head was bent and his hands were clasped behind
him, as he strolled, looking neither to the right
nor left.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked Nick, who had not had a look
at the man’s face.</p>

<p>But at that instant the musing one looked up, and
the morning sun fell right across his countenance,
bringing up plainly every feature.</p>

<p>It was only a momentary glimpse that the chief and
Chick had of the man’s face. But it was enough for
both of them to see it so clearly that both knew it
was the man who called himself Howard Milmarsh.</p>

<p>“Either that man is Howard Milmarsh, or I can’t
tell the rightful owner of this place from a rascal
who ought to be in jail. I wonder whether I shall find
out which is which?”</p>

<p>Carter had said this loudly enough for his assistant
to hear, and it was in a tone of conviction that the
latter replied:</p>

<p>“You’ll find out, chief, and, by ginger, I believe I
know already what the verdict will be.”</p>

<p>“You are more sure than I am, Chick. I thought I
<em>knew</em> that the man who is in the Universal Hospital is
Howard Milmarsh. But that man we have just passed
looks as much like the real one as the other. It’s a
puzzle. But I must untangle it somehow.”</p>

<p>“We are going to do it to-night, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes. At least, we’ll try. You have the long dusters
and big caps in that suit case, haven’t you, Chick?”</p>

<p>“All right, chief. We won’t look like ourselves
when we are rigged up for our little visit to the big
house on the hill. You can bet on that.”</p>

<h2 id="XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br />
<small>BY UNDERGROUND.</small></h2>


<p>It was soon after darkness had set in—a darkness
helped by a drizzling rain which had begun in the afternoon—when
two men in long dusters and with large
caps pulled over their eyes crept through the shrubbery
at the back of the Milmarsh mansion and moved
along the stone foundation wall, as if looking for
something.</p>

<p>“Here it is, Chick. Howard Milmarsh, the father,
showed it to me once when we were walking through
the grounds. It’s the hole through which they used
to take the colored people so that they could keep them
in safety till they could be sent up State and over the
border into Canada.”</p>

<p>“It was part of the ‘underground railroad’ in slavery
days, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The Milmarsh who lived here seventy years
ago was an abolitionist, and his wife was particularly
enthusiastic in trying to help negroes to escape from
the South. It’s a good thing for us now. Come
along!”</p>

<p>The hole that Nick had discovered in the stone
foundation wall was about four feet square, and was
covered by a wooden board on which composition
had been placed, so that it looked like the stones all
about it. Only one who knew where to look would be
likely to discover that there was any break at all in
the wall.</p>

<p>The disguised board was easily removed by pressing
a secret spring.</p>

<p>“Get in, Chick. Enter feet first. Sit down and let
yourself go.”</p>

<p>“I may get a hard bump,” protested the young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, you won’t. I promise you that,” replied his
chief.</p>

<p>Chick gingerly stepped into the hole, with his back
to the outer world and his feet straight out before
him.</p>

<p>Hardly had he assumed his position when he began
to slide, and in a second he was scooting down a long,
smooth chute in black darkness. Suddenly he stopped
in the midst of what felt like a gigantic feather bed.</p>

<p>He heard his chief chuckling at the hole, and he
realized that when slaves were brought into this house,
every care was taken that they should not be hurt in
the process.</p>

<p>He got to his feet, and found himself standing on
a smooth floor, while Nick softly warned him to keep
out of the way.</p>

<p>There was a slight scuffle in the distance, then a
whisking sound, and his employer shot into the midst
of the feather bed, just as he had done.</p>

<p>The glow of an electric flash light showed him that
his chief was by his side, smiling, as he cast the light
about.</p>

<p>“You see, Chick, this room is cut off from all the
inhabited part of the house—except in a roundabout
way that I will show you later. It is solidly built, and
no one could get at the people housed here except
by that one opening in the outer wall. The one by
which we came in.”</p>

<p>Nick also pointed out marks on the wall where
bunks had been, and told his assistant that it had
been possible for nearly two hundred persons to sleep
in the room at one time.</p>

<p>“I have been told that more than two hundred refugees
have stayed here all night on occasion. But I
doubt whether they slept much. Now come with me.
I’m going to find out to-night, if I can, where the real
Howard Milmarsh is.”</p>

<p>Chick did not reply. He had implicit confidence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the great detective by whom he was proud to be employed,
and he only wondered how the object was to
be accomplished—not whether it would be.</p>

<p>In one corner the detective fumbled for a few moments,
and a panel in the wooden wall swung open
on a pivot in the center, top, and bottom. There was
space enough for an ordinary-sized person to go
through, and even a stout one could have squeezed
in.</p>

<p>Nick went ahead, and from the darkness beyond
told his assistant to follow.</p>

<p>No sooner were they both in, than Nick directed the
glow of his flash light up a flight of narrow, winding stairs.
They seemed as if they might go to the top of
the house, for Chick felt as if he never would be at
the end of turning around.</p>

<p>But the chief stopped after a while, and, opening
another concealed door, went through, followed by
Chick. They were in a narrow hall now—one with
half a dozen twists and turns.</p>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>It was the chief’s voice in a low tone of warning,
for Chick had just made an exclamation of annoyance
as he stumbled over a low stool.</p>

<p>Chick was silent. Then he started, for there were
voices close to him, although he could not see anybody
but his employer.</p>

<p>“That sounds like Andrew Lampton,” whispered
Chick.</p>

<p>“It is Lampton.”</p>

<p>“And there’s Louden Powers.”</p>

<p>“Right!”</p>

<p>“Where are we, chief?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you. Sit on that stool—the one you just
now fell over.”</p>

<p>Nick turned the light on the stool, and also revealed
that a similar stool was by its side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief sat on one stool and Chick sank upon the
other. This brought their faces close against the wall.</p>

<p>“Move that little, round piece of wood in front of
you, Chick. It works on a pivot. I have another one
here.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” ejaculated Chick. “It’s a peephole!”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s in the carved frame of a big picture.
That prevents the hole being observed from the other
side. We are now looking into the dining room. I
suppose this narrow place we are in was used when
negroes were being helped to freedom. Anyhow, it’s
mighty useful to us now. I’m glad Howard Milmarsh’s
father showed it to me.”</p>

<p>“Why did he do it?”</p>

<p>“Only because I was curious about this wonderful
old house. He was proud of its mysteries and unexpected
twists and turns. He and I were good friends,
and he knew he could depend on my keeping a silent
tongue about anything he might show me. Take that
lesson to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” returned Chick, in rather a hurt tone.
“You never knew me to talk about anything you
told me, did you?”</p>

<p>The chief reached over and took his assistant’s
hand. He had not meant to injure his feelings.</p>

<p>“Look through the hole and take note of everything
you see. There are chinks all about the big picture
in front of us—in the frame, that is—and we ought to
hear easily.”</p>

<p>Nick was right in this. They could see and hear to
perfection.</p>

<p>The dining room of the Milmarsh mansion was an
immense, lofty room—more a hall than a room indeed.
It was hung with pictures of dead-and-gone Milmarshes,
in the manner of a baronial hall in Europe,
and was richly lined with tapestries, while frescoes
and other ornamentation seemed never-ending.</p>

<p>From the center of the ceiling hung a gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
chandelier, which had been fitted with electric lights
when that style of illumination came in. But there
were old-fashioned sconces for wax candles still on
the gilt arms, with the curious crystal pendants which
went with the candles, as well as pipes and tips for gas.</p>

<p>At a table in the middle of the room, on which remained
the white cloth for dinner, sat three men.
They were Louden Powers, Andrew Lampton, and the
young man whom Lampton had declared to be Howard
Milmarsh.</p>

<p>The last-named was speaking, in a thick voice that
made Nick think of that night, years ago, when
Howard Milmarsh had rushed from the Old Pike Inn,
believing himself the murderer of his distant cousin,
Richard Jarvis. The voice seemed to be absolutely
the same.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this Paradise City business, Lampton,”
he was saying, in an angry tone.</p>

<p>“You have nothing to say about it,” snapped Louden.</p>

<p>“It’s my property, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s your property,” assented Lampton. “But
you never would have proved your right to it without
our help.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I could,” snarled Milmarsh. “Carter
would have helped me if I’d asked him.”</p>

<p>The other two men laughed derisively.</p>

<p>“Why, you idiot!” broke out Powers. “He would
not admit that you are Howard Milmarsh.”</p>

<p>“His Howard Milmarsh is in a hospital in New
York.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t believe that man is Howard Milmarsh,”
declared the man whom we will call that for convenience,
as has been done before in this narrative.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know who he is,” said Powers. “He
took him there as Milmarsh, and, of course, he doesn’t
like to have to confess that he has turned out to be
T. Burton Potter, after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“If that fellow ever should recover his mind and
memory——”</p>

<p>The young man said this musingly, as he poured
himself out another glass of champagne.</p>

<p>“If he did, all the fat would be in the fire again,”
finished Andrew Lampton, also taking some more
champagne.</p>

<p>“Well, now, the point is what are we going to do
about the Paradise City affair?” said Louden Powers.
“There is a row brewing, and the people who have
put their money into it want to know when they will
get their plots. Can’t you get those lawyers in New
York to settle matters for you, Howard?”</p>

<p>“How am I to do that? They have let me take
possession, but they are slow to believe things—like all
lawyers. They pretend to have some doubts still
whether I am the right man.”</p>

<p>“What do they want?”</p>

<p>“They insist that until Carter concedes in writing
that the estate is in the hands of the real Howard
Milmarsh, they can allow me to remain here only on
sufferance.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, the people can’t have their Paradise
City plots. That’s all there is to it. When you get a
good hold on the bank account, as well as just this
property, we shall be able to pay those who make a
fuss, and we shan’t care what the others do.”</p>

<p>Louden Powers said this in harsh, grating tones,
as he grinned over his wineglass at the other two.</p>

<p>“How much money is there in the Paradise City
treasury?” asked Andrew Lampton.</p>

<p>“After paying the manager and assistants, and the
rent for the offices, I have three thousand dollars and
a few odd hundreds,” announced Powers, consulting a
small notebook.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take a thousand of it. I’m tired of having
no money. It’s all very well to live in a fine house, but
I want some cash.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have everything you want here,” snapped
Louden Powers. “Plenty of the best kind of food,
wines, motor cars, servants, and everything else a man
could want. What are you bothering about money
for?”</p>

<p>“None of your business, Louden, what I want it
for. Are you going to hand over that thousand?”</p>

<p>“You may as well,” put in Andrew Lampton. “If
you have three thousand clear, each of us is entitled
to a thousand. The odd hundreds you can throw back
into the treasury. We may want another dividend
before this matter is all straightened out. I begin to
doubt whether Howard Milmarsh ever will come into
his own.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it,” whispered Carter significantly to
Chick.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="XXV">CHAPTER XXV.
<br />
<small>DOUBTS.</small></h2>


<p>There was more squabbling over the division of the
booty, and much more champagne was disposed of
before an agreement was reached. But at last, with a
grudging look, Louden Powers brought out a leather
wallet and slowly counted out ten hundred-dollar bills
to each of his companions.</p>

<p>“There you are!” he grunted. “But it is a foolish
thing to draw all the capital out of a business before
the time comes to wind it up. I’m going to bed. It’s
early—not much after eleven. But I’m tired. I have
to go down to New York to-morrow, to see how things
are at the office.”</p>

<p>“Hear that, chief?” whispered Chick.</p>

<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, he may be going to make a get-away.”</p>

<p>“He won’t succeed.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Patsy Garvan will be with you,” was the chief’s
short reply. “Now, keep still and watch.”</p>

<p>Louden Powers staggered to his feet, and Carter
realized, for the first time, how drunk he was.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to get some help to find my way to the
elevator,” he mumbled. “What kind of wine is that,
anyhow, Howard?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to ask my father—if you know where
he is,” laughed Howard Milmarsh. “He bought it.”</p>

<p>“Good for the old man!” squealed Andrew Lampton.
“I say it’s durned good booze! I wish I never
had to drink anything worse! Whee! Come on, old
top! We’ll find the elevator!”</p>

<p>He lurched over to Louden Powers, and the two
worthies reeled out of the room, and across the hall
to the elevator, which was operated by an electric
button by the passenger.</p>

<p>“I doubt whether they will be able to get upstairs
in that,” muttered Chick. “I wish we could sail in
and knock their heads together!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“We’d make such a racket that somebody might tell
the actual truth in the confusion. I can’t believe that
fellow sitting at the table is the real Howard Milmarsh.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I, Chick. But he has possession, and
he could not have got that if he had not convinced
the lawyers. And Johnson, Robertson &amp; Judkins are
not easily convinced.”</p>

<p>“That guy down there at the table is a blackguard.
The real Howard Milmarsh never behaved that way,
did he?”</p>

<p>Nick was thoughtful for a few moments, and he did
not answer until he saw the man in the dining room
reach down into the pail on the floor at his side, in
which was still an unopened bottle of champagne, and
take out a large piece of ice, which he pressed to his
forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have seen the real Howard Milmarsh do just
what this fellow is doing now. Of course, that does
not prove that they are the same person, but it is
an indication. I have not <em>quite</em> made up my mind
yet.”</p>

<p>For another fifteen minutes the young man at the
table sat there holding ice to his forehead. Occasionally
he drank some water from the carafe on the
table.</p>

<p>At last he got up and walked the length of the
room and back, as if to test his ability to do it without
staggering.</p>

<p>He was fairly successful, and he uttered a mirthless
laugh as he dropped again into his seat.</p>

<p>“The blackguards!” he burst out suddenly. “The
infernal, low-bred rascals! They can’t even be decent
crooks! This game they’ve played on the poor devils
who are paying for that swamp land is worse than
stealing the pennies from a blind man’s dog!”</p>

<p>He took from a pocket the ten hundred-dollar notes
and gazed at them thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“For two cents I’d put a match to these. I may
not be a saint, but, by the big bull of Bashan, I never
was a robber of widows and orphans. At least, not
when I knew it!”</p>

<p>He reached over to the silver match box on the
table, and savagely struck a light. He held the lighted
match till it burned up brightly, and then, with the
notes in his left hand and the match in his right,
laughed again in the hollow way he had before.</p>

<p>“Look!” whispered Chick excitedly. “The dub is
going to burn up a thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>But he didn’t do it. Just as he was about to touch
the flame to the money, he shook his head, and, with
another dry chuckle, blew out the match and dropped
it in an ash tray.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t!” he mumbled. “What would be the
use of that? The people who paid it in wouldn’t get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
it. Besides, if those two scoundrels have a thousand
apiece, why shouldn’t I? And I need cash. This business
of having a big house, with servants and everything
else, but no money, isn’t the kind of thing I
like. I suppose there’ll be hail Columbia when it comes
time to pay these servants, to say nothing of the butcher
and groceryman and all the rest of the tradesmen.”</p>

<p>He was about to pour himself out another glass of
champagne, but changed his mind and took some water
from the carafe instead. It looked as if he were trying
to sober up.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go to bed,” he exclaimed, after another
pause, during which he seemed to be trying to collect
his thoughts in some sort of orderly array. “And, in
the morning, I’ll begin to have this affair brought to
a focus. I’m tired of going on this way for nothing
at all, just to please other people.”</p>

<p>He got up from his chair, and made his way out of
the room with much better grace than had the other
two men.</p>

<p>In a moment or two a man in livery, who seemed
to have been waiting somewhere close by until the
convivial trio should disappear, came into the room
and began to clear away the remnants of the feast,
as well as the glasses and other paraphernalia that
spoke of a carouse.</p>

<p>He had not proceeded far in his work when another
man, dressed just like him, also stole into the room
and silently assisted the first.</p>

<p>When they had taken everything out of sight, including
the tablecloth, leaving the handsome mahogany
table, with its highly polished surface, glittering in
the light of the chandelier, one of the men solemnly
addressed the other:</p>

<p>“What do you think of it, Dobbs?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know! How does it strike you, Kelly?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you better at the end of the month.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! I could tell you now—if I wanted to,”
blurted out Dobbs.</p>

<p>“Better not. Don’t give yourself away,” interrupted
Kelly.</p>

<p>“Well, I say that if I don’t get my wages the day
they’re due, it will be a lawyer for mine.”</p>

<p>“That’s different. The same here.”</p>

<p>“Then you think it is——”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying.”</p>

<p>“Punk?”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!”</p>

<p>“Hum! Let’s get out! There’s some good bottled
beer downstairs.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” responded Kelly, with alacrity.</p>

<p>When they’d both gone out of the room, Chick
again turned to his chief, with a grin:</p>

<p>“Isn’t this the queerest joint you ever struck, chief?”</p>

<p>“It seems so. At the same time, I have more serious
work here than to speculate on the intentions of
footmen, or even of the men who have the privilege
of drinking champagne ordered by my old friend,
the late Howard Milmarsh. I made him a promise
the last time I saw him alive, and I’m going to keep my
word. Follow me, and I’ll show you something more
about this house that you may regard as curious.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br />
<small>GHOSTLY VISITANTS.</small></h2>


<p>Wonderingly, Chick followed his employer along
the dark corridor, lighted at intervals by the electric
flash, until they came to some more winding stairs
leading upward.</p>

<p>“There seems to be a secret house within a house
here, chief,” muttered Chick. “A great place for
ghosts, I should say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Carter permitted himself a low laugh, and turned
to place a hand on Chick’s shoulder, as he replied:</p>

<p>“Do you know, Chick, you have just about struck
the nail on the head without meaning it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t get you.”</p>

<p>“You will in a few minutes. Here we are!”</p>

<p>They had gone up so many stairs that Chick had no
clear idea of how high they were in the house, when
Carter pressed on the wall to his right and opened a
panel door like that which had admitted them to the
mysterious region they had been in for so long.</p>

<p>This panel led into a large, lofty room, with the
moonlight streaming through a skylight.</p>

<p>“What’s this, chief?”</p>

<p>“This used to be Howard Milmarsh’s laboratory
and studio,” was the quiet answer. “It is at the top of
the house, as you see, and there is only one other way
of reaching it besides that we came in by. That is
through the bedroom he used in his lifetime. It is on
the floor below this.”</p>

<p>“Wonder whether the present Howard Milmarsh
is in the same bedroom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Nick. “But if he isn’t,
he is sure to be in one very near it, for the best bedchambers
are all on the floor below this.”</p>

<p>“Where do the servants sleep?”</p>

<p>“In the west wing, some distance away from this
part of the building. But come over here. I may
want some help.”</p>

<p>There was a table and mirror against a wall across
from the panel door, with two electric lights each side
of the glass.</p>

<p>Chick turned on these lights without hesitation.
He knew that the room was so arranged that the
light would not show outside, even if anybody should
happen to be watching, which was not at all likely.</p>

<p>“Howard Milmarsh was deeply interested in theatricals,”
explained Nick. “He often had private performances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in this house while his wife was alive, and
he always took part in them himself. This was his
dressing room. He used to ‘make-up’ here, and I
suppose he had as fine a collection of grease paint and
other articles needed in a theatrical dressing room as
you could find anywhere in America to-day.”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to do?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make myself look as much like the
late Howard Milmarsh as I can,” was the reply. “He
always wore a mustache and pointed beard as long as
I knew him, and they were iron-gray toward the end
of his life. Here are the very things in this drawer.”</p>

<p>Carter took some false beards and mustaches, and
began to examine them, occasionally twisting one to
bring it to the desired shape.</p>

<p>“Am I to take a hand in this?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“You certainly are, and you must not waste time,
either. We’ve both to be ready before midnight. You
make-up like Howard Milmarsh, the present one.
There is a full wardrobe in those closets along the
wall. You can find anything you want. Just a plain
sack suit is all you will need. But there’s a black-and-white
check that Howard used to wear a great deal.
Put that on. It’s distinctive.”</p>

<p>It was five minutes to twelve when Nick Carter surveyed
himself critically in the mirror and decided he
was enough like the father of the present Howard Milmarsh
to pass for him. Then he looked at his assistant.
He was much pleased, and he gave him the
praise he felt he deserved.</p>

<p>“Excellent, Chick! Grease paint is a wonderful
transformer—if you know how to use it. You have
changed all your features. When that fellow downstairs
sees you, he’ll think it’s himself.”</p>

<p>“Or his ghost!” said Chick, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Ghost!” repeated the chief. “That’s it exactly.
Haven’t you wondered what we are doing all this
for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“I supposed you had your reasons,” replied Chick
humbly.</p>

<p>“I have. I’m going to scare that fellow into telling
the truth, if I can. If he isn’t the real Howard Milmarsh,
I’m in hopes I’ll make him confess the fraud.”</p>

<p>“But suppose he <em>is</em> the real one, how will you work
it then?”</p>

<p>“That’s a question,” answered the detective soberly.
“But I do not expect to be called on to answer that.
Now, put a little talcum powder on your cheeks, so
that you will look a little more ghostly.”</p>

<p>“How about a smudge of phosphorus? Here’s some
in this box. The old gentleman certainly did not overlook
anything.”</p>

<p>“It might add still more ghostliness to the general
effect,” assented Nick. “Rub some on your cheeks
and hands, and I will do the same.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter had not exaggerated when he said that
anybody seeing Chick might think him the real Howard
Milmarsh of the present day.</p>

<p>He might have remarked that his own make-up
was also perfect. If the elder Milmarsh had been
alive, anybody meeting the detective would have declared
him to be the multimillionaire steel manufacturer.</p>

<p>A distant clock somewhere in the house, with deep,
cathedral tones, boomed out twelve strokes.</p>

<p>“Midnight!” observed Nick. “Just the time for a
ghostly visit.”</p>

<p>He went to a door, which was fastened, like the
others, by a secret spring, and opened it wide. A narrow,
winding staircase, of the kind with which they
had become familiar that night, led to a hall, and along
this a short walk brought them to a large door with
heavy portières in front.</p>

<p>Howard Milmarsh, the elder, had been so intimate
with the great detective that he had told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
more about the ways of his mansion than he ever had
confided to any one else.</p>

<p>So Nick soon opened the door, and then another one
beyond.</p>

<p>“Stand still, Chick!” he whispered. “I must see
whether he is in bed.”</p>

<p>A moment later he returned to his assistant and
whispered:</p>

<p>“He is in bed and fast asleep. Do not speak a word
unless I give you a signal. Walk softly, and keep out
of sight for the present.”</p>

<p>Chick followed his chief into a large room which
looked more like a bedchamber of a hundred years
ago than of to-day.</p>

<p>Instead of the light furniture to which people are
accustomed now, with brass or mahogany bedstead and
other articles to correspond, there was an immense
four-poster, with mahogany cornices, from which depended
thick hangings of purple velvet with lace lambrequins
draped over them.</p>

<p>A small electric light in a ground-glass globe hung
over a table where it would not shine in the face of
an occupant of the bed, but which relieved the gloom
of the great, shadowy apartment.</p>

<p>The man who might or might not be Howard Milmarsh
lay asleep in the bed. His potations had stupefied
him to such an extent that he slumbered heavily,
his breath coming in long, stertorous snores, and he
did not move.</p>

<p>Nick took from his pocket his electric flash, and,
turning the light full into the face of the sleeper,
shook him gently and continuously.</p>

<p>It required several seconds to bring the man to his
waking senses, and even then he was only half-conscious.
Lazily opening his eyes, he closed them
quickly, for he had been blinded by the glaring eye
of the flash light. When, after a pause, he opened
them again, the light was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello! What’s this?” he mumbled. “I must have
been dreaming!”</p>

<p>Satisfied that this was the explanation of the strange
light he thought he had seen, Howard Milmarsh composed
himself to drop asleep again, when a deep voice
commanded him to “Awake!”</p>

<p>He started up in bed and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Heavens, I heard somebody speak!” he muttered.
“Lampton or——”</p>

<p>It was at this instant that he made out a shadowy
form standing near the bed, and as he stared the light
of the flash was turned full upon the figure of the
ghostly visitor, and, traveling slowly upward, at last
came to the face of the elder Howard Milmarsh. Then
the light was blotted out, and the man in the bed, shaking
with superstitious fear, fell back upon his pillow.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked the strange voice out of the
gloom.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he said, the man in the bed
replied:</p>

<p>“I am Howard Milmarsh. Who the deuce are
you?”</p>

<p>There was a touch of defiance in the last sentence
that did more to make Nick believe in the genuineness
of this Howard Milmarsh than anything else he might
have said. But he remembered that a man who would
have the nerve to impersonate another to the extent
of taking possession of a large estate, with an eye to
an immense fortune in money later, would hardly be
lacking in self-assurance.</p>

<p>“I am your father, Howard Milmarsh, who desires
to see his son come into his rights. That is
why I am here.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>Nick realized that it would be impossible to frighten
this rather cool individual very long. At first, when
he had been awakened from his sleep in such a curious
fashion, he had shown terror. But that was passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
away, and the detective expected that soon he would
be called on to deal with this young man in a material
way, if at all.</p>

<p>“This looks as if he might be the real Howard,”
was his inward comment. “Howard was never afraid
of anything, and certainly he had no superstition in
his nature. He would be quite likely to send a bullet
through a ghost. Perhaps it is well this gentleman
has no gun handy.”</p>

<p>“If you are my son, you will be able to answer certain
questions that I shall put to you,” went on Nick.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then, in an incredulous tone,
the young man in the bed said:</p>

<p>“I’ll answer any questions. But be honest about it,
and don’t say you said things you didn’t.”</p>

<p>He had been edging away to the other side of the
bed, and after the first startled moment it struck the
detective that the young man was remarkably self-possessed,
considering that he was talking to a supposed
ghost.</p>

<p>“What did I say to you just before you went down
to the Old Pike Inn that night you killed Richard
Jarvis?”</p>

<p>The detective watched narrowly to see what effect
his recalling Jarvis’ death would have on the man
who had killed him.</p>

<p>He saw a decided start, and then the man in the
bed fell upon his face on the farther side of the bed,
his face buried in the pillow.</p>

<p>“What did I say?” repeated Nick, in hollow tones.</p>

<p>He waited for a full quarter of a minute, during
which the supposed Howard Milmarsh writhed about
the bed, with his face in the pillow.</p>

<p>“Will you answer me?”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” moaned the other.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you understand?”</p>

<p>There was such agony in the voice that asked this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
that Nick was puzzled. Surely it must be remorse
that caused the alleged slayer to groan in such utter
despair.</p>

<p>“You really are Howard Milmarsh?” asked Nick,
after a pause.</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” came the answer in muffled tones
from the depths of the pillow. “Why do you ask
that?”</p>

<p>“Look up—and see!”</p>

<p>Before Nick said this he beckoned to Chick. When
Howard Milmarsh slowly lifted his face from the
pillow and turned it toward the other side of the bed
his eyes rested upon what might have been the reflection
of himself in the clothing he had worn on the
night of the fatal poker party at the Old Pike Inn.</p>

<p>For an instant he gazed at the figure of Howard Milmarsh,
with its creeping flames on the cheeks—for
Chick had not been sparing of his phosphorus—and a
muffled shriek sprang from his lips.</p>

<p>Then, as Carter opened his mouth to speak, there
was a loud noise outside the room, and a door at the
farther end crashed open!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br />
<small>A FIGHT IN THE DARK.</small></h2>


<p>Two men came surging into the room just as Nick
and his assistant backed away into the shadows behind
the bed curtains.</p>

<p>“The light, Chick!” whispered Carter.</p>

<p>Chick understood, and instantly snapped out the
electric light in the ground-glass globe on the table,
putting the room in black darkness.</p>

<p>They could hear somebody padding about without
shoes not far away, and they knew that Howard Milmarsh
had jumped from the bed and was ready to
fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no part of the detective’s plan to have an
open battle with this young man, however. Whether
he were the real Howard Milmarsh or not, the detective
did not desire to let him know who was on his
track. He might guess, but he shouldn’t <em>know</em>, if it
could be helped.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had been in this bedchamber before, in
the lifetime of the elder Milmarsh, and he remembered
where the switch was that controlled the whole lighting
of the room.</p>

<p>Taking out his jackknife and feeling his way to a
certain part of the wall behind him, he put the electrical
connection out of business with a skillful twist.
He knew there could be no light in the bedchamber
now unless one were brought in from outside.</p>

<p>As he jumped back from the disabled switch, he
heard the padding feet moving toward it, followed,
an instant later, by a muffled oath in the tones of the
young man from the bed.</p>

<p>“Fooled him!” muttered Nick.</p>

<p>Suddenly there arose a terrific racket across the
room, and he knew that Chick had come into collision
with one of the two men who had come in, at least.</p>

<p>“Get out, you monkey!” growled Chick in a disguised
tone. “Here’s one for you!”</p>

<p>A crash told the detective that Chick had floored his
assailant, but a quick renewal of the battle was indicated
by more noise, with the panting of two men in
desperate contest.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that a sinewy arm was
thrown around the detective’s neck from behind, while
a knee was thrust into his back. The assailant evidently
understood the gentle art of garroting, for he
pulled hard while he pressed his knee harder against
the detective’s back.</p>

<p>There could be only one result to an attack like this,
made suddenly and unexpectedly—Nick Carter had to
let himself go to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>As he did so his adversary was on top of him, trying
to hold him down and obtain a grip on his throat.</p>

<p>This was something different, however. Nick had
no intention of allowing such a liberty to be taken
with him. He had yielded to the garrote, because it
was the only thing to be done. Now, however, when
he had a fair chance, things wore another aspect.</p>

<p>He rolled over like a panther, and in a second had
his assailant by the collar of his pajamas. It was not
the detective’s desire to hurt the young man. The
thing was to escape from the bedchamber without being
recognized.</p>

<p>It was hardly likely that his identity was suspected.
His disguise was so good that nothing of his real personality
could show through it, and no one in the
house had any reason to suppose he and Chick were
near Milmarsh.</p>

<p>The two men who had crashed into the room—and
who had been summoned by an electric bell sounded by
a push button from the bed—were the two liveried
men—Kelly and Dobbs—who had cleared away the
cloth and glasses from the dining table, but who were
without their coats when they broke in.</p>

<p>It was these two men with whom Chick was engaged
in the darkness while his chief dealt with the
occupant of the bed.</p>

<p>“You’ll spring ghosts on me, will you?” mumbled
Nick’s adversary, trying to break loose. “I’ll give
you something that will make you wish you were a
ghost.”</p>

<p>Nick was obliged to admire the pluck and determination
of the man. It seemed to him just what the
real Howard Milmarsh would do, and it made the
affair more complicated than ever to his mind.</p>

<p>There was a second crash at the other end of the
room, followed by a grunt of satisfaction which Nick
knew was in the tone of his assistant and which indicated
that he was the victor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>But he could not say anything, for fear of betraying
himself. He had resolved that, at all odds, he
must hide from this man who was fighting so hard to
get away from him that he had been followed into his
very bedroom by one who was resolved that the actual
Howard Milmarsh should have his rights.</p>

<p>“Somebody coming outside!” Chick squealed, hiding
his real voice most effectively. “Which way?”</p>

<p>“The same!” thundered his chief, in a husky bass
entirely unlike his own voice. “Hurry!”</p>

<p>He had been obliged to speak at last, but he did not
think his tones had revealed who he was.</p>

<p>There was no time for consideration. The disturbance
in the room—particularly the falling to the
floor of the two servants under the impact of Chick’s
hard and skillfully used fists—had awakened the two
rascals who had been carousing in the dining room,
and they were coming to see what the fuss was about.</p>

<p>Louden Powers and Andrew Lampton were both
seasoned drinkers. When they staggered out of the
dining room and into the elevator, both were well
steeped in wine. Many men in such a condition would
have slept through any disturbance.</p>

<p>But these were not of that kind. Powers awoke
first, and, getting into some of his clothing, went to
the next room to get Lampton out. Then the two
went along the hall to see what was going on in Howard
Milmarsh’s bedroom.</p>

<p>It would not have mattered so much to Carter about
these men coming if they had been in the dark. But
each one had lighted a candle—placed in their room
so that they could have a light for cigars—and these
candles gave light enough for them to see where
they were going.</p>

<p>As soon as Nick knew that others were coming to
the room, and that they bore lights with them, he felt
that he must act quickly to escape recognition.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have you, and find out what the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
is!” chuckled the supposed Howard Milmarsh, as he
pushed Nick a little backward. “I’ll tell you a ghost
story of my own before I’m through.”</p>

<p>This boasting assertion was the last he had the
opportunity of making. Stooping and catching the young
man around the waist, the stalwart detective lifted him
from the floor and hurled him clear across the bed
to the floor beyond.</p>

<p>As he fell, his head struck the wall, and he doubled
up, unconscious.</p>

<p>Nick did not trouble himself to find out whether the
man was hurt badly or not. There was no time. Instead,
he felt in the bed for pillows, and grabbed up
two of them.</p>

<p>“The door! Get!” he shouted, but carefully disguising
his voice in a sort of squeak. “You know
where it is. I’ll attend to these others!”</p>

<p>Chick had seen the two men coming along the hall,
and had recognized them. Before he could obey his
chief and retreat, they had seen him, and Louden Powers
cried out hastily:</p>

<p>“What’s the game, Howard? Why aren’t you undressed?
Is it the jimjams you have? Say, young
fellow, you ought to let the wine alone after this. It’s
too much for that bean of yours. You’re not used
to it. Get into bed and sleep. That will give the rest
of us a chance. Holy blue! Have you been knocking
the butlers down, too? Say, this is going to make
trouble. None of ’em will stay with us, and they’ll
be wanting their pay before they will get out, too!”</p>

<p>Louden Powders was advancing, with Lampton, as
he said all this, and both men were in the bedroom,
candles and all.</p>

<p>Nick did not give them time to say anything more,
and he stopped their further progress into the room in
a most effective fashion.</p>

<p>He hurled the two pillows, one after the other, at
each candle, sending them both flying out of the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of their holders and plunging the room again into
black darkness.</p>

<p>Before he had thrown the pillows he saw that Chick
had reached the part of the wall where the secret
panel door was situated, and he knew that a simple
pressure in the right spot would provide them both
with an exit.</p>

<p>His aim was true with the pillows. Notwithstanding
that he was hidden from the two rascals by the
bed hangings, and that he had to hurl the pillows
nearly the whole length of the room, he sent each
straight to its mark, and neither Louden Powers nor
Andrew Lampton saw where they came from.</p>

<p>No sooner was the apartment in darkness than Carter
rushed over to where Chick stood and seized him
by the arm.</p>

<p>“Do we beat it now?” whispered Chick.</p>

<p>“Yes! Quick!”</p>

<p>The secret panel swung open, and the chief shoved
his assistant ahead of him through the opening. Ere
he could follow, he heard Louden Powers’ voice remarking,
with a shiver:</p>

<p>“What’s that? A window open? Hurry, Lampton!
He’s getting out that way! Come on! We’ll fool
him yet!”</p>

<p>Nick slipped through the narrow doorway made
by the opening of the panel, and, as he closed it softly,
he whispered to his assistant, with a low laugh:</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if they are the persons who are
fooled!”</p>

<h2 id="XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br />
<small>THE ELDER JARVIS.</small></h2>


<p>Although the adventure had not turned out as satisfactorily
as he could have wished, Nick felt that he
had made some gain toward getting at the truth with
regard to the identity of Howard Milmarsh.</p>

<p>The conspirators knew that they were watched,
and whether this young man whom they seemed to
be leading by the nose was the real heir or not, they
had been made aware that they would not have it all
their own way without investigation by other parties.</p>

<p>It was while they were removing the make-up and
costumes they had worn in the characters of the two
Howard Milmarshes that Carter and his assistant discussed
the probability of this being the actual young
Howard, after all.</p>

<p>“The preponderance of evidence is on his side, I
must confess,” declared Nick, as he finished dressing
in his own clothes, after removing all the grease
paint and false hair from his face, as well as the
iron-gray wig he had worn as the elder Milmarsh.
“He looks like Howard, has the same voice, and certainly
fights like him.”</p>

<p>“And yet you can’t quite believe in him?”</p>

<p>“Not quite. If only the Howard Milmarsh who is
sick in the Universal Hospital would get well, there
would be little trouble in deciding positively whether
he or this one who has possession of the place is the
true one. It is a curious case—and as puzzling a one
as I ever attacked.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do now?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“You are right, Chick,” smiled his chief. “That is
getting right down to business. Well, I think we’ll
go back to the Old Pike Inn and get some sleep. There
will be a busy day for us to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“All days are busy—especially since we took up this
Howard Milmarsh case,” observed Chick, smiling.</p>

<p>“That’s true. Well, come on, and don’t make a
noise as you move along. There are listening ears on
the other side of the wall, remember.”</p>

<p>They made their way out of the Milmarsh mansion
without discovery, and in due time reached the
Old Pike Inn, where they went to bed and slept till
the morning was fairly well advanced.</p>

<p>Indeed, they were still at breakfast in the private
dining room into which Captain Brown had led them,
so that none of the other guests should see them, when
the captain came in and told them that Thomas Jarvis
was in the office and wanted to see Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>“Thomas Jarvis! Do you mean Richard Jarvis’
father?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has been living here in the inn for a
month past. He must have seen you come in or go
out, and recognized you. Those raincoats and caps
are pretty good, but a man who knows you and could
get a good look at your face would know you in spite
of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may as well show him in here,” answered
Nick. “I believe I know what he is after.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes Thomas Jarvis had visited the detective,
told his story, and been dismissed. He had come
to say that, as Howard Milmarsh had not appeared
to claim the property of his late father, it came automatically
to the Jarvis branch, and as he, Thomas,
was the only living Jarvis, of course it was his.</p>

<p>“You know that Howard Milmarsh <em>has</em> appeared,
and that he is living in the Milmarsh residence at
this very time?” asked Carter.</p>

<p>“I know that a man calling himself Howard Milmarsh
is there,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe he is the real man, then?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so.”</p>

<p>“Your tone said it,” was the detective’s rejoinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you believe he is the real Howard Milmarsh?”
asked Thomas Jarvis.</p>

<p>“Unless another one should turn up with a better
claim, I have no right to doubt it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I more than doubt it,” declared Jarvis
roughly. “I am the heir at law of this property, and
I’m going to have it.”</p>

<p>“I wish you luck,” returned Nick.</p>

<p>With the exception of formal “Good mornings!”
that was all of the interview, and Thomas Jarvis retired.</p>

<p>“This puts a new twist into the case,” laughed
Nick, when the door closed. “Is it not strange that,
with a great fortune like the Milmarsh estate, to say
nothing of the wonderful steel-manufacturing business
that goes with it, there should be at least one
claimant outside of these two Howard Milmarshes.
But I wouldn’t give much for Thomas Jarvis’ chance.”</p>

<p>“He’s the fellow who killed his son accidentally,
isn’t he?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“Not so bad as that, although Richard Jarvis was
killed while quarreling with his father. He stumbled
over something as he was about to strike his father,
and fell, with his head against an iron fender. If he
were still alive, I suppose he would be claiming to be
Howard Milmarsh’s heir.”</p>

<p>“Are we going back to New York to-day?” asked
Chick.</p>

<p>“Yes. There is nothing to be done here. Until
we can bring the poor fellow in the Universal to his
senses, I don’t see much hope of coming to a decision.
And that may never be, according to one of
the nurses who has been watching the patient.”</p>

<p>“Doctor Grayson doesn’t say so, does he?”</p>

<p>“The doctor is away from the city, unfortunately.
He has been called to attend a wealthy and influential
patient of his in Chicago. But he’ll be in New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to-morrow, I’m told, and then I may obtain some dependable
information.”</p>

<p>But the detective and Chick did not go to New
York that day. Circumstances arose to prevent them
of a nature that neither had anticipated.</p>

<p>They were still in the room in which they had breakfasted
and had their interview with Thomas Jarvis,
when Captain Brown, after a hasty knock, burst into
the room with excitement flaming out all over him.</p>

<p>“Carter! What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. What is it?”</p>

<p>“They’re here!” spluttered the captain.</p>

<p>“Who? What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“The Paradise City people!”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I don’t know what you’re driving
at, Captain Brown,” returned Nick, somewhat impatiently.
“Who are the Paradise City people?”</p>

<p>Captain Brown had cooled down a little by this
time, and he took a seat and fanned himself with his
hat for a few moments, as he pointed to the window.</p>

<p>Chick stepped over and looked out.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s broken loose?”</p>

<p>Before he could answer, there was another knock
at the door. In quick response to the detective’s
“Come in!” a young man, also in considerable excitement,
surged into the apartment.</p>

<p>The young man was Patsy Garvan!</p>

<p>“Say, chief, I been wanting to get to you, but I
thought I’d better wait till I knew you’d want me.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“There’s going to be merry hilltop to pay at Milmarsh’s
to-day, and we ought to get busy, or there
won’t be any house for Howard Milmarsh to take
when he does prove his rights.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about it, Patsy?” put in Chick.
“I see a big mob of people going up the road—men
and women—and they look ugly.”</p>

<p>“They are ugly. See that big fellow at the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of the procession in a blue sweater? Know who
he is?”</p>

<p>Chick peered harder at the disorderly gathering
making its way up the winding road toward the gates
of the Milmarsh estate. But the big man had gone
too far for sure recognition.</p>

<p>“Looks as if it might be Bonesy Billings!” said
Chick. “It’s about his build, and I know he has
bought property in the Paradise City place.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it, Chick,” nodded Patsy. “It is Bonesy,
and he’s hotter’n the inside of a coke oven. He’s got
on to the fact that this isn’t any more than a swamp,
and he’s come up here to have it out with the guys
that sold him the plot.”</p>

<p>“How about the manager and his men at the office
in New York, Patsy?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“The office is busted up and the men are gone. I’m
told they only hired the furniture there, so they didn’t
have to move it. They paid up everything in the way
of rent and for the furniture two days ago, and beat
it for—for—Paradise, I guess,” laughed Patsy.</p>

<p>“They paid up everything, you say?”</p>

<p>“Everything about the office. You can bet they
were slick enough to do that. They didn’t want to
have any more publicity than they could help. If
they’d tried to beat the office rent or the furniture hire,
they’d have been followed up here to Milmarsh, and
that would have meant a fuss for the other guys who
are living high in that big house on the hill.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Milmarsh residence?” asked Captain
Brown.</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s what I mean,” replied Patsy. “It’s
the only big house on a hill around here that I know
anything about. Gee! Look at that bunch going
up the road. There’s nearly a hundred of them.”</p>

<p>“And women among them,” remarked Captain
Brown.</p>

<p>“Sure! That’s what’s going to make it so hard on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the other side. The women have helped to save the
money that’s gone into that phony real-estate, and
they’re going to get back their coin or bust somebody.
You can bet your bottom dollar on that!”</p>

<p>“Who is at the back of all this swindle?” asked Captain
Brown. “Do you know, Carter?”</p>

<p>“I know only what is apparent to everybody,” was
the detective’s answer. “The property is on the Milmarsh
estate, and there is a Howard Milmarsh living
on it at present. The advertisements of Paradise
City say that the long-lost heir is back to his own, and
that he means to give people of limited means an
opportunity to find homes in the country. You’ve
seen the booklets, haven’t you, captain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I thought you might know something
more than they made public. Advertisements are
splendid things in their way, and as a rule they are
truthful. But exaggeration will creep into them occasionally,
and often there are details which the writer of
the advertisement forgot to put in.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Bonesy Billings says,” remarked
Patsy. “He told me that coming up on the train.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you came up from New York with this crowd,
then?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Yes—those that came from New York. Some of
’em live at places along the railroad. There’s a bunch
from Yonkers, for instance, and others from the
Bronx. But they are all here.”</p>

<p>“How was it worked up?” asked Chick, smiling,
for he knew Patsy had the whole matter in his head.</p>

<p>“They’ve been having meetings for more than a
week,” explained Patsy. “I heard about them two
days ago, and I’ve been to two of the meetings. They
were hot stuff, I’m telling you. Some of the speakers
were in favor of coming up here with dynamite
bombs and blowing everything to blazes.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Milmarsh house?” queried Captain
Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mean everything up here. The Old Pike Inn
was to go, too, because some of them say it harbors
men who are mixed up in this swindle to rob poor
people of their savings.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” exclaimed Captain Brown, more interested
than ever. “Look here, Carter! We can’t
let this go on! We’ll have to take a hand in it. You
will go up to the house with me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I intended to go up there,” was the quiet reply.
“Can we use your big motor car?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I’ll have it got ready at once. Then
we can take a roundabout way and get to the house
before the mob.”</p>

<p>“That was what I calculated on,” returned the detective.</p>

<p>Captain Brown hustled out of the room to order his
car, while Nick gazed out of the window at the excited
mob of both sexes on their way to the Milmarsh
mansion.</p>

<p>“We shall have to save the property at all events,
Chick,” he remarked, without turning around. “The
rightful heir must not have his place destroyed before
he has time to settle down.”</p>

<p>“Have you found the rightful heir, chief?” asked
Patsy Garvan eagerly.</p>

<p>“I believe I have,” was the detective’s calm reply.</p>

<br />
<small>THE INSURGENTS.</small></h2>


<p>While Nick Carter and his two assistants were
waiting for the motor car that was to take them up
to the Milmarsh home ahead of the crowd of angry
purchasers of Paradise City property there was increasing
wrath among the men and women following
Bonesy Billings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll burn the place down over his head!” yelled
one frantic woman, who had given up every cent her
late husband had left her to make a payment on Paradise
City. “Any man who would rob a poor widow
ain’t fit to live.”</p>

<p>“Kill him first and burn down the house with his
carcass in it!” screamed another feminine voice.</p>

<p>“Louden Powers! He’s the one!” roared a big
man.</p>

<p>“He ain’t no worse than Andrew Lampton!” declared
another.</p>

<p>“Kill Howard Milmarsh! He’s the worst!”
shrieked the woman who had spoken first—the widow.
“If he had any of the goodness of his father in him,
he couldn’t have done it.”</p>

<p>“What are we waitin’ for, Bonesy?” demanded a
man nearly as big as himself, who acted as a sort of
lieutenant. “Ain’t we goin’ right up there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we want to know what we’re goin’ to do
when we’re there,” returned Billings. “Things has to
be did reg’lar an’ up to the handle. These mugs we’re
goin’ to see is mighty slick. Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t slick enough to rob us!” shouted the widow.</p>

<p>“They’ve did it already,” cried the other woman.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’re goin’ to get our money back, an’
take it out of ’em by lickin’ ’em, too,” growled a man
who had not spoken heretofore.</p>

<p>“If you guys will keep still a minute, I’d like to
address the meeting,” announced Bonesy Billings,
somewhat pompously.</p>

<p>“Good ol’ Bonesy!” enthusiastically shouted a
young fellow in the background. “Let him spiel!”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” ordered Bonesy ungraciously. “This
here ain’t your put-in nohow.”</p>

<p>“Scuse me!” rejoined the other, with a sarcastic
inflection that he would not have dared to employ if
he’d been nearer the powerful Billings. “It was in
my nut that I had the floor. Scuse me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonesy Billings cast a look of disgust in the direction
of the rather “fresh” young man in the rear.
Then he cleared his throat for a speech, with a loud
and impressive “Hem!”</p>

<p>“Feller citizens—an’ ladies!” he began. “It has
been decided that we has all been soaked good an’
hard by the mugs what is up in that house on the
hill—the same as is knowed by all on us as the Milmarsh
mansion.”</p>

<p>“Good stuff!” interrupted the irrepressible man at
the back of the gathering.</p>

<p>“I’ll come over an’ paste you in the jaw if you don’t
shut up!” menaced Billings. Then, resuming his oratorical
tone, he continued: “We have tried to get
satisfaction at the office in N’ York, an’ we’ve been
told ev’rything will come out all right, though we can
see it won’t. The fellers at the office has beat it
for parts unknown, an’ what have we?”</p>

<p>“Swamp!” cried the regular interrupter at the back.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Billings. “It is jest swamp,
an’ sech swamp you couldn’t dry it out in a million
years, nor fill it in, nuther. As for buildin’ houses
there, it couldn’t be did. Yet we’ve paid out our good
money for this here swamp land, an’ now the guys
that beat us out of our coin is laughin’ at us. What
are we goin’ to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Kill ’em!” shouted the widow.</p>

<p>“With hatpins,” added the other woman.</p>

<p>“We ain’t goin’ to take chances on the ’lectric chair—unless
they make us,” returned Billings. “But we
are goin’ right into the house an’ demand our money
back. If we don’t git it, then we will——”</p>

<p>Bonesy Billings flourished a long, powerful arm,
and there was a bludgeon in his grip.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt as to what he intended.
His hard face was set, and he meant business.</p>

<p>He did not continue his harangue. He looked over
the stern faces of his followers, and he knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
they would stand by him to the end. They felt that
they had suffered the worst kind of injustice and that
no punishment would be too great for the men guilty
of it.</p>

<p>It was only about a week before that suspicion
began to ripen into conviction. There had been mumblings
among those who could not get to see the places
they had bought. They wanted to know what they
had to show for their money besides the gaudy “certificates”
that had been issued by the Paradise City
Improvement Company.</p>

<p>There were no real signatures on the certificates.
Such names as were there had not been written. They
were facsimiles of signatures that no one recognized.
Neither “Powers,” “Lampton,” or “Howard Milmarsh”
were among them. This omission had been
pointed out in the meetings that had been held.
Bonesy Billings laid particular stress on this. He
also had his eye on other details which did not appeal
to him as sound.</p>

<p>For example, he had known the young man who
lay in Universal Hospital very well, and had liked him.
To Billings he was known as Bob Gordon. But Billings
knew that Bessie Silvius and her father, old
Roscoe Silvius, declared that he was really Howard
Milmarsh. If this Bob Gordon could only tell what
he knew, it might straighten out the Paradise City
affair. Billings could not see how anybody else had
a right to the name of Howard Milmarsh and to
sell land belonging to the estate.</p>

<p>He turned to look again at his followers. He had
taken his place on a large stump at the side of the
road when he made his speech, and he was still there
when he decided to send forth a last word of direction
and warning.</p>

<p>“It’s near two mile up to the front door of the
Milmarsh house,” he told them in his stentorian tones.
“You’d better walk in reg’lar double formation—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
is, two by two. Me an’ Kid Plang,” indicating his
stalwart lieutenant, “will lead. Keep yer lamps on us,
an’ be ready to take orders as I give ’em. We’ve got
to have discerpline if we’re goin’ to git anywhere.
Don’t fail to remember that there. Forward!
March!”</p>

<p>Steadily the double column moved on. The road
was smooth, and, though it was uphill, no one seemed
to mind it. All were keyed up for action, and thought
only of obtaining recompense for what they paid out
and suffered as the result of what, they were now
convinced, was nothing but a heartless fraud.</p>

<p>Up the winding carriage drive they marched, and
soon were gathered on the wide porch in front of the
tall, forbidding-looking house.</p>

<p>Every window was closed and protected by sun
blinds. The outer door, which usually stood open,
was also closed. There were no signs of life to be
seen.</p>

<p>Yet Bonesy Billings was convinced that there were
eyes behind those sun blinds which had taken careful
note of their approach. He knocked at the door
with his knuckles at the same time that his lieutenant,
Kid Plang, rang the electric bell again and again.</p>

<p>For several minutes there was no response. Then
suddenly a voice hailed them from above, and they
saw that Andrew Lampton was at an open window
at the third-story.</p>

<p>“What do you want, gentlemen?” he asked suavely.</p>

<p>“Ah, can that ‘gentlemen’ stuff!” shouted the lieutenant.
“We want to come in for a conference.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“You know what about well enough,” roared
Bonesy Billings. “Where’s Howard Milmarsh?”</p>

<p>“He’s here. But he is not saying anything. I’ll
do the talking—if there is to be any.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can bet there’s going to be talking!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
We want our money back that’s been paid for those
plots in Paradise City.”</p>

<p>“You do? Why?”</p>

<p>“Because the whole thing is a swindle!” replied Billings.
“That’s why!”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken. Paradise City is there, and as
soon as Howard Milmarsh has settled certain details
connected with the estate, buildings will go up and
you will all have the homes, as agreed.”</p>

<p>“We’re coming in,” declared Billings doggedly.
“We can’t talk business standin’ out here.”</p>

<p>“You can’t come in. Mr. Milmarsh would not
care to have so many people walking over his carpets
and rugs. I’ve told you all there is to tell. Now
I’ll say good morning!”</p>

<p>A clod of earth was hurled by somebody in the
crowd. It smashed itself against the wall, by the side
of the window, not more than a foot from Andrew
Lampton’s head. He drew it in quickly, closing the
window.</p>

<p>“Give him another!” screamed the widow. “Send
a stone up there and smash the glass. He’s only tryin’
to put us off.”</p>

<p>“Shet up!” ordered Billings. “I’m runnin’ this
thing. Don’t nobody chuck anything at the house
unless I tell you to.”</p>

<p>Billings was so big, and his habit of having his own
way gave him such command, that several men who
had taken stones from their pockets they had picked up
on the way put them back.</p>

<p>“What are we goin’ to do, Bonesy?” asked Kid
Plang, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“We’ll rush that front door if somebody don’t come
out and give us satisfaction,” replied Bonesy. “Look!
There’s somebody else at the window. Wait a moment,
and let’s see what he’s goin’ to do.”</p>

<p>It was Louden Powers this time. He opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
window at which Lampton had appeared, and called
out sharply:</p>

<p>“Look here, you people! There’s nothing to be
made by your coming up here making a disturbance.”</p>

<p>“We’re not making a disturbance,” interrupted Billings.
“We want to see Mr. Milmarsh.”</p>

<p>“You can’t see him. Is that all?”</p>

<p>“No; it isn’t all by a jugful!” snapped back Bonesy
Billings, trying to hold back his wrath. “We’ve been
beaten on this Paradise City deal, and we are goin’
to find out what Howard Milmarsh means to do
about it.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you that,” replied Powers. “He is going
to see that every one gets what is right. There
is no reason for you to say you have been beaten.
You have not. Paradise City is all right—that is, it
will be.”</p>

<p>“We want to see Howard Milmarsh,” repeated Billings
resolutely.</p>

<p>“You can’t see him. And if you don’t get away
from here and go back to where you came from,
there’s going to be a lot of arrests and some clubbing,
most likely. We’ve telephoned the police, and they’ll
soon be here.”</p>

<p>With this threat, Louden Powers suddenly pulled
the outside sun blinds shut, and directly afterward Billings
and his followers heard the window come down
with a slam.</p>

<p>“Well, boys! There’s only one thing to be done
now. The front door, and—altogether!”</p>

<br />
<small>NICK CARTER’S WORD.</small></h2>


<p>While the threat about the police caused some of
the more timid spirits in the crowd to hang back and
even talk of going home, the majority were determined
to fight their way into the house at all hazards.</p>

<p>“We’ll git there, if everybody joins in!” proclaimed
Billings. “As many men as can squeeze in help me
to push down this door.”</p>

<p>But the door was heavy and solidly bolted in place,
and the combined strength of half a dozen powerful
men was insufficient to force it from its hinges on one
side or its fastenings on the other.</p>

<p>“We’ll keep on till we do it,” was Billings’ decision,
and the attack was renewed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there was a decided feeling of apprehension
inside the house. Andrew Lampton, Louden
Powers, and the man whom they called Howard Milmarsh
were all in the bedroom which had been occupied
by Louden, which was at the front of the house,
and at whose window had taken place the parley with
Bonesy Billings.</p>

<p>“I’ve got the outside blinds bolted,” announced Louden
Powers, “and the window is closed. Of course,
if ever they got through the sunblinds, they could
easily smash the window. My idea is to fight them
off as they come in. We can’t hope that the house
is strong enough in itself to keep them out. It is
not a castle.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we make some terms with them?” suggested
the alleged Howard.</p>

<p>Louden Powers turned on him with a snarl.</p>

<p>“What for? And how are you going to do it? Do
you want to give up your thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“I might not have to do that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, you would. And they would expect Lampton
and me to do the same. Well, I won’t do it.
Neither will Lampton. All we can do is to keep these
people out till the police get here.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t telephoned the police, have you?”
asked Lampton, with a look of alarm.</p>

<p>Louden Powers contrived to wink at Lampton,
while, in a loud tone, he replied:</p>

<p>“Of course I have. We may not be able to hold
off this crowd ourselves, and we’ve got to have the
police. You can see that, Howard.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything, except that you have got me
into an infernal scrape with your Paradise City idea.
What is the use of it, just for a little ready money
now, when we shall have plenty of it as soon as the
estate is settled. I was a fool to give in to you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that,” put in Lampton. “Things
are getting mighty hot in this house, and I’m inclined
to get away from it while the going is good. What
was the meaning of all that fuss last night? Who
were those two men who looked so much like the
two Howard Milmarshes?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who the old man was. But it’s my
belief the other was the fellow who got hurt in that
fire and who says he is the real Howard Milmarsh.
It couldn’t have been anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you suppose he got into your bedroom?”</p>

<p>“There’s only one way to account for it, and that
is that Nick Carter had a hand in it. He has been
trying to beat me out of this property with that fellow
who is in the hospital, and it may be that his man
has recovered enough to come here.”</p>

<p>“Got his memory back, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. He could be brought
here to scare me without that. He didn’t speak last
night—only looked at me.”</p>

<p>“He was quite a scrapper,” observed Lampton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, he could be that and still not have all his
senses about him,” maintained the other.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you one thing, fellows,” suddenly broke
in the possessor of the Milmarsh mansion. “I’m just
about sick of this whole thing. It looks to me as if
I’m the scapegoat, while you get all the profit. I’m
going to give up. There’s too much trouble in trying
to prove that I am the rightful heir. I’d rather be
poor, and worry along as I have done for years than
take all this that I’ve gone through with since I’ve
been up in this devilish house.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you? Are you——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” broke in the young man violently. “I’m
going to give the whole game away. I don’t care
what you say. I’m not going to take the chance of
five years in the pen just to——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” broke in Louden in his usual masterful
way. “You have to do what you’re told. You
are the heir to the Milmarsh fortune. We’ve proved
that for you. Now you talk about backing out, just
because you have not nerve to hold on to what is your
own. You make me sick!”</p>

<p>“Here! Quit fighting over that!” broke in Andrew
Lampton, running into the room from the landing,
where he had been listening to the noise outside.
“Those fellows have broken down the outer door, and
they are coming in. They won’t have much trouble
forcing the inner door, for that’s half glass.”</p>

<p>There was a crash of glass below, which told that
the mob had made its way into the house.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” roared the voice of Bonesy Billings.
“Bring him down! We want him!”</p>

<p>Already they could hear the rumbling of many feet
upon the lower floor, when a clear, ringing voice rose
far above the din.</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Nick Carter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed as if his voice had some power far above
that wielded by the order of authority. The men on
the third-story heard the mob actually falling back
and stumbling down the stairs.</p>

<p>“How did <em>he</em> get in here?” growled Louden Powers.</p>

<p>“Didn’t come in with the mob, did he?” suggested
Lampton.</p>

<p>“I told you,” gasped the man they called Howard
Milmarsh. “I knew this man, Carter, was in it. He
brought those two people into my bedroom last night
when I had been drinking so much that my nerve was
nearly gone. I was sure of it! He told me some time ago
he’d get me if I didn’t act square. Now I know I
haven’t been square with him, and here he is.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s taking our side, you idiot!” grumbled
Powers. “He’s holding them back.”</p>

<p>“He has his own purposes to serve if he is. Look
here, Louden, I’m going to tell him just what is the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Howard Milmarsh,” broke in Andrew Lampton.
“You’re crazy. All this bother over your estate has
turned your brain. Isn’t that so, Louden?”</p>

<p>“Of course. But, listen!”</p>

<p>“We want Howard Milmarsh!” they heard Bonesy
Billings shout. “He’s robbed us, and we want him.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter had come out of one of the rooms on
the second floor and now stood at the head of the
lower flight of stairs, with Chick and Patsy Garvan
on either side of him. All three were looking down
at the mob with a coolness that caused even the excited
men and women below them to wonder.</p>

<p>“You can’t have Howard Milmarsh,” said Carter.
“Bonesy Billings, you know me, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Billings came a step nearer, so that he could look
into the face of the detective. Then he uttered an
ejaculation of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. And this is Chick by my side. You know
him, and Patsy Garvan!”</p>

<p>“Sure I do!”</p>

<p>“Say, Bonesy,” put in Kid Plang behind impatiently,
“what’s all this guff you’re giving us? Who are these
guys? None of ’em is Howard Milmarsh. I know
that. And they ain’t Louden Powers nor Andrew
Lampton, either, I’m willing to bet. Lead us up them
stairs if you’re goin’ to. If not, I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>Kid Plang tried to push past Billings. One sweep
of Bonesy’s powerful arm sent him down among the
others in a disgruntled heap.</p>

<p>There was a hubbub of shouting and grumbling,
and Bonesy turned to shake his fist at them as he
bellowed:</p>

<p>“Shut up down there, or I’ll come an’ lick some
of you! Can’t you see I’m talking to a gentleman for
the benefit of all of us?”</p>

<p>“It don’t look like it,” growled Plang, as, he got
to his feet, but carefully kept out of reach of Bonesy’s
arm and fist.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Carter,” went on Billings, addressing
the detective, “I know you are square, and so are
them two with you. But we’ve come here to get back
the money what’s been stole from widders an’ orphans
an’ workin’ men who have had to work hard
for everything they have. The money was stole on
the pretense that there was a fine tract of land on this
estate what was to be sold on easy terms for homes.”</p>

<p>“I know that’s true,” remarked Nick quietly.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he’s getting at?” muttered
Lampton to Powers on the upper landing.</p>

<p>“Listen, and we’ll find out. Then we’ll know what
to do.”</p>

<p>Louden Powers spoke calmly. He was much the
bolder rascal of the two. His iron nerve it was that
had brought the plot to its present point. He did not
despair yet of putting it through to entire success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve looked into this thing, and we find the land
is nothing but swamp, and it wouldn’t be possible to
build houses on it—at least, not till thousands of dollars
had been spent on draining it and filling it in.
There ain’t no sign as these ducks what have our
money mean to do any such thing.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Then we’re going to see this Howard Milmarsh
and make him give back our money first of all. After
that we’ll sue him for damages. There’s good lawyers
in New York what will take our cases and not
ask no fee unless they win for us. An’ we’d be sure
to win, so we’re goin’ up here to find this Howard
Milmarsh—if you’ll step out of our way, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” called out somebody in the heart
of the crowd. “Take us to Howard Milmarsh!”</p>

<p>“Howard Milmarsh is not here,” said the detective
in loud, clear tones.</p>

<p>“What?” blurted out Billings. “Not here? We
have had positive word that he is in this house.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Bonesy,” returned Nick, still in a quiet,
distinct voice, “did you ever know me to say a thing
that was not absolutely true?”</p>

<p>“Never,” was the unhesitating testimony.</p>

<p>“Then, I tell you, Howard Milmarsh is not in this
house. Do you believe me?”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. The crowd below
and the three men on the third floor, at the top of
the stairs, were waiting for what Bonesy Billings
would say. At last came the response:</p>

<p>“<em>I believe you, Mr. Carter.</em>”</p>

<p>The man who stood between Louden Powers and
Andrew Lampton, and whom they had persistently
addressed as Howard Milmarsh, made a movement as
if he would go down the stairs.</p>

<p>The other two dragged him back savagely.</p>

<h2 id="XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.
<br />
<small>NICK CALLS A COUNCIL.</small></h2>


<p>The trouble was not over yet, however. The emphatic
manner in which Bonesy Billings had said he
believed the detective made a great impression upon
the majority of his followers.</p>

<p>But there were some who were not prepared to accept
the dictum in the face of what they had been told. It
was common report that Howard Milmarsh was living
in the house he had inherited from his father,
and that he was there now. For some reason it seemed
that the detective was trying to shield him.</p>

<p>Few of those in the mob had not heard of the famous
detective, and all knew his reputation for
straightforwardness. They were fully aware that a
falsehood would be simply impossible for him. Still,
how could they reconcile what he had just said with
what they believed to be their actual knowledge?</p>

<p>“Look here, Bonesy!” ventured Plang while discreetly
remaining out of arm’s reach. “If Howard
Milmarsh isn’t in the house, we can’t do any harm
by going up to talk to those other two men. We know
they are here.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea!” agreed three or four voices
at the back.</p>

<p>“What about it, Bonesy?”</p>

<p>Billings looked inquiringly at Carter.</p>

<p>“It would do no good,” said the detective. “The
men you refer to would not give you any satisfaction,
and they would probably mislead you. If you
will go away now, I will give you my personal pledge
that you shall not lose anything over this Paradise
City affair. You shall have back the money you have
laid out, and with it enough to compensate for any
loss or trouble you have suffered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can guarantee that,” grumbled
Kid Plang.</p>

<p>“I promise it <em>in the name of Howard Milmarsh</em>!”</p>

<p>“You seem to think you have a right to speak for
him,” persisted Plang. “How did you work that, if
you haven’t seen him? You didn’t know we were
coming here to-day. Nobody did for certain, because
we kept it a secret. Bonesy can tell you that.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” ordered Billings. “Leave me out while
you’re takin’ it on yourself to conduct these here negotiations.
I’ll ’tend to you later,” he added, with menacing
significance.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m speakin’ for most of the crowd when I
say we’re goin’ up them stairs,” rejoined Kid Plang.
“We want to see Louden Powers an’ Andrew Lampton.
This bunch hasn’t come all the way from New
York without wantin’ a run for its money. An’ I’ll
help ’em to get it.”</p>

<p>“Hey! Look there!” suddenly screamed the widow
who had been prominent from the first. “There he
is! See! Look at him!”</p>

<p>“Who?” roared half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“Howard Milmarsh! There he is. I’ve seen his
picters, an’ I know it’s him. He’s hidin’ behind them
other two men! No, they’re shovin’ him back! I
don’t care for nobody. I’m goin’ up!”</p>

<p>The woman tried to force herself to the front, but
the mob was too solidly packed in, and she could not
move.</p>

<p>Kid Plang tried to take advantage of the disturbance
caused by the shrieking woman to edge his way
past Bonesy Billings.</p>

<p>A straight left, delivered by Billings with splendid
precision, sent Kid Plang back for the second time
since he had been on the stairs. Only this time he
was knocked senseless. The point of the chin had received
the blow. He fell in a heap in a corner of
the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>This encounter was the signal for a general rush
forward on the part of the men and women below.</p>

<p>The widow had caught a glimpse of the white face
of the man who was known to them, from his pictures,
as Howard Milmarsh, and, while most of the
crowd did not believe she had seen the man she said
she had, a few held that Carter had been mistaken when
he said Howard Milmarsh was not in the house.</p>

<p>“Chick!” whispered the detective.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Tell Patsy!”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Patsy Garvan was on the other side of Chick, and
Carter did not care to give orders that would be heard
by the others.</p>

<p>But it was easily understood by his two assistants
that they were to hold the stairs at all hazards, even
before Nick called down to Bonesy that the crowd
must not come up.</p>

<p>“I’m with you, Mr. Carter!” was Billings’ reply.
“I wouldn’t care if Howard Milmarsh came and stood
at the top of them stairs now; I would take your
word, even agin’ my own eyesight.”</p>

<p>The detective smiled. The loyalty of this burly
truckman—who had seen how he was willing to risk
his life to save a girl and her father from a fire, and
who therefore respected him from the bottom of his
heart—touched him.</p>

<p>“I will explain to you later, Billings,” he said, as
he thrust one man back by sheer strength, and then
lifted another to throw him on top of the now frantic
mob which was storming the staircase.</p>

<p>For five minutes Billings, Carter, Chick, and Patsy
kept the crowd back. Some blows were struck, but
not many, considering how many persons were in
the fray. The truth was that Nick abstained from
hitting anybody unless he were forced into it, while
his assistants, taking their cue from him, also used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
their strength instead of fighting the frenzied invaders.</p>

<p>Bonesy Billings was as unwilling to strike as were
the detectives. These men whom he was now striving
to push out of the house were his friends. But
a short time before he had been helping them to batter
down the doors to the house. It would have been
hard indeed if he had felt obliged to employ his tremendous
fists against them now.</p>

<p>His faith in Nick Carter was so great that he had
resolved to end the siege, but he did not feel any the
better disposed toward Howard Milmarsh or the two
men who had been with him at the back of the Paradise
City enterprise.</p>

<p>When he had kept his tacit pledge to the great detective
and cleared the house, then he would return
to know what it all meant.</p>

<p>That was exactly what he did. In due time, by
alternate threats and persuasions, plus considerable
physical force, he put the last of the mob on the porch
outside, and saw them headed for the railroad station,
three miles away.</p>

<p>“Wait there for me,” were his parting words. “I’ll be
your delegate, and you shall hear all that I find out
here. Mr. Carter is on our side, and he is going to
see that we have justice.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Carter!” shouted an enthusiastic
man in the mob.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Bonesy. “That’s the right thing!
Give ’em with a will, boys—and girls, too!” he added,
as a fortunate afterthought.</p>

<p>The women joined with the men, their shrill tones
being plainly audible through the gruff voices of the
men as they cheered the great detective again and
again while marching down the road.</p>

<p>“There you are, Mr. Carter!” cried Bonesy, with
a grin, as he returned to the house. “Now, what is
the next thing to be done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Louden, come down here!” called out Nick, as he
looked up the stairs. “And bring with you Andrew
Lampton and that man who looks like Howard Milmarsh.”</p>

<p>“He <em>is</em> Howard Milmarsh!” grunted Louden.
“How did you get into this house?”</p>

<p>“That ought not to matter much to you,” said Nick.
“It is a good thing for you I got in somehow. Patsy,
run around and tell Captain Brown he can come in
by the front entrance now. He is still sitting in his
car, I guess.”</p>

<p>Louden Powers raised his eyebrows as he heard
Carter give these instructions. He began to wonder
how many persons were to be brought into the house
by this detective who had taken charge of matters
so completely.</p>

<p>“Come down, Louden!” repeated Nick. “It will
be better for you.”</p>

<p>There was a threat in these quiet words that Louden
Powers well understood. Although he had not
been caught in the raid in Jersey City a few nights
before, he did not know how much evidence there
was against him in connection with the counterfeiting
proceedings. He came downstairs.</p>

<p>“Is Lampton and the other man with you?” asked
Nick.</p>

<p>“We are coming,” replied Lampton for himself.</p>

<p>“And the other man?”</p>

<p>“He’s here.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter had appeared to trust to the rascals to
bring down the man who had been called Howard
Milmarsh. As a matter of fact, he did not depend
entirely on them. He had given a private signal to
Chick, and that exceedingly efficient assistant was
ready to compel obedience by Louden and Lampton
if there had been too much hesitation on their part.</p>

<p>“We’ll go into the dining room,” said Carter. “Get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
some of your servants to come and open the sun
blinds. We may as well have light from the outside.”</p>

<p>The two men—Dobbs and Kelly—who had been
keeping discreetly in the background while the row
lasted, now stepped forward and let the sunshine into
the great dining room.</p>

<p>“Now, chairs for everybody!” ordered Nick. “I
will sit here, near the door. Is Captain Brown coming?”</p>

<p>“Here I am, Carter,” answered Captain Brown for
himself, as he came in with Patsy. “I saw that mob
going down the road. I hope they won’t stay at the
Old Pike Inn and make a fuss.”</p>

<p>“You have plenty of employees and special police
to deal with them, haven’t you?” asked Nick carelessly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Only I shouldn’t like my guests to be
disturbed. It would hurt the reputation of my house.”</p>

<p>“They have taken another road and gone straight
down to the railroad station,” announced Patsy.
“There’s another party wants to come in, chief. I
told him I’d ask you.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Thomas Jarvis.”</p>

<p>“Jarvis?” cried Nick. “Let him come in, by all
means! This is going to be a most interesting gathering.
Mr. Billings, you will kindly move over to that
other chair. I should like Mr. Jarvis to sit next to
me.”</p>

<p>“Anything you say, Mr. Carter,” said Billings, with
a grin. “I wasn’t never in sech a swell place as this
before—not to set down with the people who belonged
to it, anyhow.”</p>

<br />
<small>MURDER WILL OUT.</small></h2>


<p>When Thomas Jarvis, with a grim expression on
his tightly closed lips, came into the room, there was
a look of curiosity on the faces of both Louden Powers
and Andrew Lampton.</p>

<p>The man who had been called Howard Milmarsh
was the only person in the large circle about the massive
mahogany table who seemed not to be interested.
He was sitting opposite Nick Carter, his head bent
forward, so that his chin almost rested on his chest,
and his eyes fixed vacantly upon the table.</p>

<p>“Now that we are all here, you may go,” said the
detective, dismissing the two menservants.</p>

<p>“Don’t we have anything to drink?” asked Louden
Powers. “Or is this to be a dry session?”</p>

<p>“We won’t drink,” replied Nick. “But I don’t
think it will be so very dry. We shall see.”</p>

<p>He did not say anything more until Dobbs and
Kelly had withdrawn. Then he made a motion to
his assistant, Chick, who locked the door and handed
the key to his chief.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Jarvis, we’ll hear you first,” announced
Carter. “What are you here for?”</p>

<p>“I’m here to take possession of my property,” replied
Jarvis. “I have had my attorney go through all
the necessary legal forms, and I demand that you all
leave this house forthwith.”</p>

<p>Louden Powers and Andrew Lampton laughed
aloud, and even Chick and Patsy indulged in a quiet
smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is anything to be said about
that, Mr. Jarvis, except to inform you that Howard
Milmarsh is here, and that therefore your claim is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
nothing at all. Your attorney should have known
that.”</p>

<p>“I’m my own attorney!” snapped Jarvis. “I have
been a lawyer long enough to know my rights.”</p>

<p>“Your knowledge of law may be fairly good—very
good,” returned the detective. “But the action
of law must be based on sound facts, and it seems as
if you have overlooked them. I tell you that Howard
Milmarsh is here to claim his inheritance.”</p>

<p>“You mean that man at the table?” barked Jarvis.
“<em>He</em> is not Howard Milmarsh.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong,” interposed Louden Powers.
“That’s just who he is.”</p>

<p>Billings had been gazing curiously at the man Powers
pointed to, and who still sat with bent head, taking
no part in the proceedings, and seeming hardly
to know that he was there.</p>

<p>Nick Carter understood what was passing in the
big truckman’s mind.</p>

<p>“There are things that seem to you contradictory,
Billings,” said Nick, as their eyes met for a moment.
“I will explain to you later. You will find that I told
you the truth.”</p>

<p>Bonesy Billings shook his head in an embarrassed
way, as he answered hastily:</p>

<p>“I hadn’t no thought of nothing else, Mr. Carter.
But I saw that gentleman over there, and I didn’t
know what it meant.”</p>

<p>“Now, that is all I have to say,” interrupted Jarvis.
“This is my house, and I should like to have it
to myself. In the absence of any other legal heir, I
am the owner. The property passes all to me, as next
of kin. My son would have inherited it had he lived.
But he died.”</p>

<p>“He was killed!” suddenly thundered Nick. “He
was struck down by a champagne bottle. There are
witnesses to prove it. I have one of them in this
room——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Carter!” interrupted Captain Brown, jumping
to his feet. “You have kept that quiet all these
years. Why should——”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you why, Captain Brown,” broke in the
detective. “There is an effort on the part of Thomas
Jarvis to rob the owner of this property of his rights,
and I am obliged to say what I do, in the interests
of justice.”</p>

<p>“Justice?”</p>

<p>It was Louden Powers and Andrew Lampton who
uttered this word in unison in an apprehensive tone.
There seemed to be something about it that grated on
their sensibilities.</p>

<p>Thomas Jarvis was sitting stiff in his chair, his eyes
fixed upon Nick Carter’s face, while he tried to mumble
some protest.</p>

<p>“I intended to keep this a secret to the end, because
I have always felt that the slayer of Richard Jarvis
had great provocation, and doubtless was carried away
by the excitement of the moment to do a deed that
he has been remorseful for ever since.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it come out at the time?” asked Bonesy Billings.
“Murders don’t often get away from the police
in these days.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Billings. I don’t suppose this would
have been hushed up if a person who—who has some
influence had not prevented all the facts becoming
known.”</p>

<p>“I’d let it go at that, if I were you, Carter,” pleaded
Captain Brown, his usually bronzed face a grayish
white. “There’s no sense in raking up such a thing
as this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” rejoined Nick. “Jarvis here has
challenged me, and I will take it up. He claims this
property is——”</p>

<p>“It is mine,” put in Jarvis doggedly.</p>

<p>“Because your son is dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“And when you knew that Howard Milmarsh had
run away from this part of the country, you figured
that he never would dare return, and that your son
Richard would be the heir.”</p>

<p>“You can say what you like. The property is
mine,” growled Jarvis, as if determined to stick to
one idea.</p>

<p>“If your son Richard were to die, it would leave
you the next of kin, so far as legal forms go. Therefore,
it might be to your interest if Richard were to
be put out of the world. He was not really your son,
you know, but your stepson.”</p>

<p>“How did you know that?” demanded Jarvis, half
rising. “It isn’t true, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is. I can prove it, if necessary,” was
the detective’s answer. “You knew that Howard Milmarsh
the elder was in poor health. You had learned
that his doctor gave him only a few more months of
life, and predicted that he would die suddenly. All
that was part of your knowledge.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to stay here any longer,” abruptly declared
Thomas Jarvis, rising to his feet. “I will go.
But there will be proper officers here during the day
to eject the rascals who are trying to steal my estate.
Good morning!”</p>

<p>But the door was locked and the key in Nick Carter’s
pocket.</p>

<p>“Better sit down till I have finished speaking,” he
advised coolly. “I do not intend to let you leave this
room until I am ready.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the rest of my story, and then you can
answer your own question. You will know what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Rot!”</p>

<p>Thomas Jarvis resumed his seat and stared at the
detective. Those about the table observed that he
seemed to have grown very much older in the last minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
or two. His eyes had become dull, his jaw sagged,
and he did not appear to be as truculent as he had
been when he came into the room.</p>

<p>“The truth is,” went on Nick, “that you killed
your son Richard in a quarrel, in the Old Pike
Inn——”</p>

<p>“Carter!” protested Captain Brown. “This will
ruin my house!”</p>

<p>“You knocked him down with a champagne bottle,
as he came toward you to strike you. He fell flat,
with his head against the corner of the iron fender.
But the blow against the fender was a trifle. It glanced
and hardly cut the skin. The stroke that killed him
was delivered by the champagne bottle in your hand!”</p>

<p>Bonesy Billings, Captain Brown, Louden Powers,
and Lampton were all on their feet, in their excitement.
The man who was supposed to be Howard
Milmarsh and Thomas Jarvis were the only persons
who remained in their chairs. Chick and Patsy had
both arisen, as if to prevent any demonstration by
Powers or Lampton.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” commanded the detective. “There is
nothing to be done. The man who killed Richard
Jarvis cannot escape.”</p>

<p>The others dropped into their seats again. The
two crooks showed more terror than had been in their
faces since first they knew Carter was in the house.
If this shrewd, deep-seeing detective could wind the
toils so easily about Thomas Jarvis for a crime committed
years ago, why would he not put them in cells
for offenses of yesterday, as it were?</p>

<p>Both Louden Powers and Andrew Lampton were
uneasy. It is true that the latter had practically a
promise of safety if he delivered T. Burton Potter
into the hands of the detective. But he was not prepared
to produce Potter except as a last resort to keep
himself out of prison.</p>

<p>As for Louden Powers, he was a bold scoundrel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and he intended to make a desperate fight to get away
if he found Carter and his men closing in on him.
Only, he wished he were not locked in a room like
this, with the odds in numbers against him.</p>

<p>“There’s Carter and his two men,” he mused. “Captain
Brown, I guess, and that big Billings. That
would be five against one—for I don’t suppose I could
count on that weak-kneed Lampton. He has some
sort of pull on the detective. I wouldn’t mind betting
he’s a ‘squealer.’”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Jarvis,” continued Nick. “You have
forced me to take this action. If you had not attempted
to cash in your crime, I should have been
inclined to let it rest in the oblivion to which you
thought it consigned. The fact that you have compelled
me to remind you of it, in the presence of these
witnesses, emphasizes the world-old truth that ‘murder
will out.’ What have you to say?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Thomas Jarvis’ gaze was
fixed on the opposite wall, and he had slumped curiously
down in his large armchair.</p>

<p>“Look here, Carter,” broke in Captain Brown again.
“You don’t have to drag me into this.”</p>

<p>“You were a witness,” replied Nick coldly. “As a
good citizen, your duty is to tell the truth—if you
are asked.”</p>

<p>It has been remarked already that Captain Brown
was a business man. He thought more of the Old Pike
Inn and its reputation than anything else on earth
probably. He groaned at this suggestion.</p>

<p>“Chief!” suddenly shouted Chick.</p>

<p>He and Patsy rushed to Thomas Jarvis simultaneously.
But they were not in time to prevent his
slipping to the floor.</p>

<p>Half a minute later, Nick, on one knee by the
side of the prostrate man, with a finger on the stilled
pulse, looked up and said solemnly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“You need not worry about being called on to testify,
Captain Brown. The matter will never come up.”</p>

<p>“Is he dead?”</p>

<p>The response of the detective was to reverently
cover the face of Thomas Jarvis with his own handkerchief.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br />
<small>STILL HUNTING.</small></h2>


<p>“Of course, Thomas Jarvis never was a real factor
in this matter,” remarked Nick, fifteen minutes later,
when all that was mortal of Jarvis had been removed
to another room. “But we will go into the claims of
that young man who has been sitting silently at the
other side of the table from the beginning of the conference,
and who——”</p>

<p>The detective broke off. The chair occupied by the
man who had been declared by Louden Powers and
Andrew Lampton to be Howard Milmarsh was empty,
and he was not in the room!</p>

<p>Patsy and Chick had both helped remove the body
of Thomas Jarvis, and no one had taken any notice
of the young man. He had been sitting there when
everybody else went out, watching the disposal of
the still form on a large sofa in the library.</p>

<p>They were just returning, with Nick Carter in the
lead, and speaking as he came, when he saw that the
alleged Howard Milmarsh had disappeared.</p>

<p>There was a search all about the house and grounds
which lasted for an hour or more. At the end of
that time, when not a trace of the missing man could
be found, Carter decided that there was nothing more
to be done there, and he told Chick and Patsy privately
that he was going back to New York.</p>

<p>Louden Powers and Andrew Lampton had both
taken an active part in the hunt. They were loud in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
their protestations that he was the real heir, and
that somebody must have spirited him away in the
interests of enemies.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by enemies?” asked the detective
quietly, when the whole party were again assembled
in the dining room. “Do you mean that
persons who believe him to be actually Howard Milmarsh
have hidden him so that they can bring a spurious
one in to take possession?”</p>

<p>“You guess well,” grinned Louden Powers.</p>

<p>“Mind I don’t guess a little too well for your peace
of mind, Powers,” was Nick’s rejoinder. “This estate
has not been settled yet. Besides, those people waiting
at the station for Billings might come up here
again and hold you personally responsible for the
fraud of Paradise City. They count you partly in
the swindle, as you know.”</p>

<p>Powers sniffed scornfully, and lighted a cigarette,
to show how much at his ease he was. Andrew Lampton
was discreetly silent. He had not the bravado of
his companion.</p>

<p>“The crowd has gone back,” announced Patsy, who
had been at the telephone. “They got tired of waiting
for Bonesy, and they took that train which went
out an hour ago. It’s lucky for these two guys that
they didn’t come back. The station agent tells me
they was as hot as fresh tamales. If it hadn’t been
a three-mile walk, some of ’em was coming back to
lick the pair of ’em, just for luck.”</p>

<p>“It is just as well,” put in Nick. “Come over here,
Billings. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>The result of a minute or two of private converse
between the detective and Billings was that the big
truckman smiled grimly and stood by the door of the
dining room, to indicate that he was ready to obey
orders at once.</p>

<p>“You see, Chick,” explained Carter to his principal
assistant, “I want you to come back with me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
New York, and it would be asking too much of Patsy
to guard those two men alone.”</p>

<p>“He could do it, all right,” returned Chick. “I don’t
think they would get away if Patsy wanted to hold
them. Besides, there are menservants in the house.”</p>

<p>“I don’t depend on servants, Chick—especially
when they are new and have no personal interest in
the place in which they are employed. You remember
we heard two of them talking about their situation
when they did not suspect that they were overheard?”</p>

<p>“When we were behind that big picture?”</p>

<p>“Yes. So I’ve engaged Billings to stay here and
act as a sort of sergeant at arms while we are away.
He and Patsy together will insure Louden Powers
and Andrew Lampton being here when we return.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do about Howard Milmarsh?”
broke in Louden Powers, who had been wondering
what the detective was talking about, but could
not very well inquire. “I think I’d better go down to
New York and look around.”</p>

<p>“Where would you look?”</p>

<p>“In places where he generally hangs out. There’s
a lot of joints where you could find him ’most any
time, and I——”</p>

<p>“I never knew Howard Milmarsh to hang about
in New York,” interrupted Carter. “I think you
have somebody else in mind.”</p>

<p>“Who?” demanded Powers defiantly.</p>

<p>“T. Burton Potter, for instance.”</p>

<p>“I’m talking about Howard Milmarsh.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will let you remain in the house here,
while I look for Howard Milmarsh. I’m quite as
anxious as you are to find him,” was the detective’s
reply. “Come on, Chick!”</p>

<p>“You want Andrew Lampton and me to stay here?”
asked Powers, with a suspicious inflection. “That’s
something different from what you’ve been giving us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
You were handing it to us that we had no business
in this house.”</p>

<p>“You have business in it now, Louden, because I
believe you may help to solve the problem of the missing
heir. Captain Brown, you will take us down to
the station, won’t you? My car has gone back to New
York.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you down with pleasure,” was the prompt
response of the manager of the Old Pike Inn.</p>

<p>Captain Brown was so relieved to know that he
would not be called on as a witness to prove that
Thomas Jarvis killed his son, that he was willing to
do anything for anybody.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you if you like,” volunteered Lampton.
“Even if I can’t find Howard Milmarsh, I might
get my hands on T. Burton Potter. You remember
you wanted me to find him.”</p>

<p>“I did want you to do that,” admitted Nick. “But
not now. Even if I don’t, it won’t make much difference
as things have turned out. You remain here
with Louden Powers. Billings, you know what to do.
You too, Patsy!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter and Chick swung out of the dining
room, with Captain Brown. No sooner were they
outside than the door closed, and they heard a key
click in the lock.</p>

<p>“Patsy and Billings are not taking any chances,”
observed Chick, smiling.</p>

<p>“That is the only way to deal with men of that
stripe, Chick. Captain, if we hurry, we can make that
two train for New York.”</p>

<p>They just made the train, and, as Nick and his
assistant sat silently side by side, while the train rushed
toward the metropolis, each was occupied with his
own thoughts.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go first?” asked Chick, as they
left the train at the Grand Central and walked through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the lofty concourse to Forty-second Street. “Home,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We’ll go there and see what mail there is,
and if anything special calls for attention. Then we’ll
visit the Universal Hospital.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose has become of that fellow
who vanished from the house up there this morning—the
man who called himself Howard Milmarsh?”</p>

<p>“That I don’t know. And I don’t much care, at
present. But I should like to correct you in one little
particular, Chick. It is Louden Powers and Andrew
Lampton who have been calling him Howard
Milmarsh. You did not hear him say much about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” assented Chick reflectively. “Here’s
a taxi. I called him up just now.”</p>

<p>“There’s an old man and a young lady waiting for
you in the library, sir,” said the butler, as they went
into Nick’s quiet house. “I told them I didn’t know
when you would be back, but they said they would
wait half an hour, anyhow. Perhaps by that time
you might be home. They’ve been in the library an
hour already. I was up there ten minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“They must want to see me rather badly,” was the
chief’s comment, as he ran lightly up the stairs. “Did
they give you their names?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. They said they would tell you when
they saw you?”</p>

<p>“Very well!”</p>

<p>Nick opened the door of his library. As he stepped
inside, he knew who his visitors were.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the young lady who was in the fire that
night,” he exclaimed, in a tone of warm welcome.
“Miss Silvius, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And this is my father. If it hadn’t been
for you, we couldn’t be here now. We wanted to
see you so much, Mr. Carter. I didn’t know till to-day
who it was that got us out of that fearful fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
I have not seen Mr. Gordon—I mean Mr. Milmarsh
since.”</p>

<p>The detective shook hands with Bessie Silvius and
her father, and then introduced Chick, who thought
the girl wonderfully pretty, and showed it in his face.</p>

<p>“I—I—wanted to thank you for what you did,
Mr. Carter,” faltered the girl. “And also—to ask if
you knew where Mr. Milmarsh is.”</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> where he is,” replied Nick gravely.</p>

<h2 id="XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br />
<small>THE GIRL IN THE CASE.</small></h2>


<p>“Will you take me to him?” asked the girl, with a
blush. Then she went on in a more resolute tone,
and as if she knew she had nothing of which to be
ashamed: “He has asked me to marry him, Mr.
Carter.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I told him,” she continued innocently.
“I said it could never be.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything,” smiled the detective.</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t. At least, you only said ‘Ah!’
But I know what you meant, and I agree with you.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would explain, Miss Silvius.”</p>

<p>“You mean that he is a multimillionaire, if he
chooses to claim his own. If I were to marry him,
people might say he was throwing himself away on
a poor girl.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would matter what people might
say.”</p>

<p>“It would matter a great deal to me,” she interrupted,
with decision. “I am getting a living by teaching
music. My father teaches the violin. We both
play when we get a chance. And—and—sometimes
the places we play at are not at all—at all nice.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl!” murmured Nick, below his breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Then, aloud: “We all have to do things we don’t
like sometimes, Miss Silvius. I can assure you, knowing
Howard Milmarsh as well as I do, that if he asked
you to marry him, he will insist on your doing it—providing,
of course, that you care for him.”</p>

<p>“I do,” burst out the girl involuntarily. Then she
blushed again. “I did not mean to say that. I’ve
told him I shall never marry, and I intend to keep
my word.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. Girls always intend to keep their word
when they make a rash assertion of that kind,” said
Nick, with a laugh. “You say you haven’t seen him
since the night of the fire?”</p>

<p>“No. We were all so much excited, and my poor
father, who had rheumatism, was in such a dangerous
state, that I was only too glad that some of the
neighbors took us in and cared for us. When I came
to myself, and could make inquiries about Mr. Gordon,
no one knew where he was. I couldn’t find any
one who remembered seeing him after he came down
the ladder, except that a policeman said he was hurt.”</p>

<p>“I took him away in my motor car,” said the detective
quietly.</p>

<p>“You did? And is he well? Can you take me to
him? Is he here, in your house?”</p>

<p>“Not at present. But what made you think of coming
here to-day? Why did you connect me with the
disappearance of this—er—Mr. Gordon?”</p>

<p>“The same policeman who told me he was taken
away in a motor car saw me on the street this morning.
We have always been on speaking terms since
the fire. He said to-day he had heard that the motor
car in which Mr. Gordon—as everybody called him
where he lived—was taken away belonged to the
detective, Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“It was not difficult to find your address. So my
father and I came down to try to see you. I was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
disappointed when your man said you were away. We
had come a long way, and I was determined to see
you if I could. So we said we would wait.”</p>

<p>“You have been here more than an hour?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we didn’t mind waiting, so long as you
are here at last. We should have waited another hour,
and more than that. And if we had not seen you to-day,
we should have been here again to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, sir,” added Roscoe Silvius, who had
hardly spoken. “I can’t say all I should like, but I
don’t think I need speak my gratitude. You surely
must <em>know</em>. Why, Mr. Carter, you plucked me out
of the very jaws of a horrible death!”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad I happened to be there,” returned
Carter earnestly. “At such a time as that any man
would have done what I did. Mr.—er—Gordon, was
as active as I was.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he couldn’t have done it alone, although I
saw that he would have given his life to save us. Then
there is the young man over there at the other side of
the room—Mr. Chick. I remember how he helped to
get my father down the ladder when it was breaking
in the middle. I wish I could say something to him
that would seem only partly adequate.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything, Miss Silvius,” put in Chick,
blushing like a girl himself. “It was the chief who
did it. I only helped him a little. And—and—it was
all in my day’s work. Nothing to talk about!”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Mr. Carter, will you take me to him?”
asked the girl, going back to her former request.</p>

<p>“I should hardly like to do that without first seeing
him,” answered the detective kindly. “You
see——”</p>

<p>“He is still ill? Isn’t that it, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>There was an agony of anxiety in her voice that
caused it to tremble as she looked eagerly into his
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he is ill,” admitted Nick. “I am going to see
him at the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Is—is he very bad?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I do not think so. The last time
I saw him, some days ago, he was up and dressed.
The trouble is with his mind. The shock of the injuries
he suffered at the fire still affects him. I hope—and
expect—it will soon pass away.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could see him.”</p>

<p>“I intend that you shall—but not just now.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Let me see. It is now four o’clock. I will go to
the hospital. You may have an opportunity this evening.
I cannot promise, but it may be so. Will you
remain here until I get back. You have spent over
an hour in this room,” he added, smiling. “You won’t
mind another half hour or so, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“How kind you are!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Not at all. As Chick says, it is all in my day’s
work.”</p>

<p>Chick brought a bundle of magazines to her, and
placed a chair for her at the big table, with another
for her father.</p>

<p>Carter smiled inwardly as he noted the assiduous
attentions of his assistant. Bessie Silvius was a pretty
girl.</p>

<p>With a cheerful nod of farewell to Bessie and her
father, and another for Chick, the detective went out,
picked up a taxi at the next corner, and sped away
to the Universal Hospital.</p>

<p>He knew his way about the big building, and did
not require anybody to show him how to reach the
private room he had engaged for Howard Milmarsh.
It was on the fourth floor, and there was good elevator
service. In fact, there were two passenger elevators,
besides others for taking patients, on cots,
from one floor to another, and for other hospital uses.</p>

<p>Most of the doctors and nurses knew him, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
had to stop and speak to several of them before he
was allowed to enter the elevator and tell the attendant
to put him off on “the fourth.”</p>

<p>As he walked down the long corridor on his way
to the room, he met the nurse who was in charge of
Howard Milmarsh at night.</p>

<p>“How is he, Miss Jordan?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He had a good night, Mr. Carter. But I haven’t
seen him since seven this morning.”</p>

<p>“His mind?”</p>

<p>“I fancy it is better. He seems to remember things
a little. I feel sure he will recover in time.”</p>

<p>This nurse had had long experience, comparatively.
She was nearly thirty years of age, and was considered
one of the most competent of her profession in
the hospital. When she said a patient was better,
there was reason to believe she was right.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it, Miss Jordan. Were you going
to see him now?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t go on till seven. But as I am in the
hospital, I’ll go in, of course, to see my patient. I
am deeply interested in the case. It is a sad one, it
seems to me, for I hear that he is a very wealthy
man.”</p>

<p>Miss Jordan looked inquiringly at Nick. But if she
expected to receive any information from him as to
Howard Milmarsh’s private affairs, she was disappointed.
The detective was not given to idle gossip.</p>

<p>The young man was known in the hospital as Robert
Gordon. If he had been entered in the name of
Howard Milmarsh, there would have been altogether
too much curiosity about him, in Nick’s opinion.</p>

<p>The two reached the door of the private room, and
Miss Jordan tapped at the door.</p>

<p>It was opened quickly, and Nick saw that there
were three doctors and as many nurses standing between
him and the bed, and all were talking with more
excitement than is usual in a sick chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?” demanded the detective.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” replied one of the doctors, with a
jerk. “The patient has left the hospital, and we are
questioning Miss Sawyer, the day nurse, to find out
how it happened.”</p>

<p>“Gone?” echoed Nick sharply. “Do you mean he
ran away without anybody knowing he had done so?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Mr. Carter. Not so bad as that. Such a
thing could not happen in a well-managed institution
like the Universal Hospital. But he went for a stroll
about the building, and on the lawn, and slipped out
of the front door without anybody in the office on the
main floor noticing him. That is the report.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the report, is it?” observed Nick dryly.</p>

<br />
<small>GETTING A FOCUS.</small></h2>


<p>“Do you mean that he was allowed to go walking
about the hospital by himself, so that he could slip
away unnoticed?”</p>

<p>It was Nick Carter asking the question, and he was
seated in the room from which Howard Milmarsh
had vanished, talking to the day nurse, Miss Sawyer,
while the night nurse, Miss Jordan, listened.</p>

<p>“I did not say that,” replied Miss Sawyer. “His
brother was here.”</p>

<p>“His brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was the very picture of Mr. Gordon—except
that he was not pale, from staying indoors, like
the patient. In everything else they were so much
alike that you knew they were twins.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you knew it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You could tell it from their remarkable resemblance
to each other. Besides, the other Mr. Gordon
said they were twins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Had you ever seen the visiting brother before?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He had never paid a visit to the patient till to-day?
Did he explain why that was?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He said he had been away from New York
for a long time—in the West. He had heard of his
brother being sick, and had come to the hospital as
soon as he arrived in the city.”</p>

<p>“And then—what?”</p>

<p>“He talked to Mr. Gordon for a little while, trying
to make him understand. He spoke of being in the
West, and mentioned a place he called Maple.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gordon appeared to recognize that name, for he
smiled and said something that sounded like a girl’s
name.”</p>

<p>“What name?”</p>

<p>“Bessie or Letty or Nelly. I could not be sure what
it was, for he does not talk plainly, you know. He
never has had complete control of his tongue since he
came here.”</p>

<p>“Was that all you noticed when they were talking?
Was there any other word that seemed to penetrate
to his brain?”</p>

<p>“Not that I saw. They talked for about fifteen
minutes. Then Mr. Gordon, as he said his name was—the
visitor—proposed that he should walk his
brother about the hospital and out to the garden at the
back.”</p>

<p>“And you let him do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It seemed reasonable that they should like
to be together, after so long a parting. Reasonable
for the visitor, that is. The patient did not make any
sign one way or the other. Beyond a half smile, as if
he were pleased when the name of the girl was on his
tongue, he was just as he always is.”</p>

<p>“It might have been better if you’d gone along, too,
Miss Sawyer,” remarked the detective. “You would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
then have seen them when they went out of the front
door. The patient had his hat, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He wore his usual clothing, hat and all.
There was nothing in his appearance different from
hundreds of men you may see on Broadway or Fifth
Avenue at any time. I wish I had gone with them.
But I argued that he would be quite safe with his
twin brother, and his absence gave me an opportunity
to look after little things about the room which are
difficult to attend to when he is there.”</p>

<p>Nick saw the nurse’s point of view, and resolved
not to make a complaint at the office, as he might
easily have done. Instead, he walked out, stepped
into his waiting taxicab, and hastened home.</p>

<p>He told exactly what he had found at the hospital,
leaving it to Chick to make any comments that occurred
to him.</p>

<p>The girl and her father simply looked bewildered.
They did not feel that any harm had been done by the
patient leaving the hospital with his twin brother.
Indeed, Bessie smiled, as if pleased that he was well
enough to go out.</p>

<p>“You know who the twin brother is, of course,
chief?” observed Chick.</p>

<p>“It is not hard to guess.”</p>

<p>“What is the game?”</p>

<p>“That we must find out.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Now.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“The Milmarsh residence, it appears to me,” replied
Nick.</p>

<p>“Milmarsh, did you say?” asked the girl. “Do you
suppose he has gone there?”</p>

<p>“It seems probable.”</p>

<p>“So it does,” assented Bessie Silvius. “Oh, Mr.
Carter! Perhaps he is quite well—recovered his memory
and everything! Well, if he has, that is all I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to know. It is all I have a <em>right</em> to know. We’ll go
now, my father and I. You won’t mind my coming
again—to-morrow, or the next day—to hear how he
is, will you?”</p>

<p>The pitiful appeal in her tones would have touched
a much harder heart than the detective’s. He walked
close to her and took one of her hands in his.</p>

<p>“Miss Silvius, I hope you will not have to wait until
to-morrow to hear how Mr.—Mr. Gordon is. I was
about to ask if you would go with us to Milmarsh.”</p>

<p>“Milmarsh?”</p>

<p>“That is the name of the little place where the residence
of the Milmarshes is up on the hill. There is
not much else there besides the Old Pike Inn and a
cluster of small stores to supply the country homes
around. We shall take a train in three-quarters of an
hour.”</p>

<p>“It will get us up there in less than an hour,” added
Chick. “It’s an express. The chief has that train
schedule down fine. He never has to look at a timetable.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, I will have the housekeeper give us
a meal of some kind. She is a wonder at preparing
a tasty luncheon or supper at short notice.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m hungry,” protested the girl.</p>

<p>“I know better,” contradicted Carter, smiling as
he saw that Chick was already at the house telephone,
giving directions to the housekeeper. “And your
father needs something, too. You wouldn’t deprive
him of the refreshment he needs, I am sure, even if
you were to refuse it for yourself.”</p>

<p>Thus chatting, to prevent Bessie Silvius objecting
further, Nick led the way into the dining room, where,
in a wonderfully short space of time, there were tea,
coffee, cold meat, cake, pie, and other articles of food,
set forth in appetizing array.</p>

<p>Roscoe Silvius evidently was hungry. The old gentleman
attacked everything set before him, and praised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
each dish as it reached him. Bessie also was hungry,
although she was not so ravenous as her father, while
the chief and Chick disposed of their food in the
businesslike manner of sensible men, who did not know
when they would get a meal again, and were determined
to make the most of the one they had.</p>

<p>The taxi that was to take them to the Grand Central
was at the door when they went downstairs, and they
were comfortably seated in a parlor car two minutes
before the time for the train to pull out.</p>

<p>“It all seems so wonderful,” declared Bessie, smiling,
as she settled down in the comfortable, roomy
chair, and looked along the car. “This morning I
had no thought of finding him again in this world.
Now, in the evening, I am on my way to see him.”</p>

<p>“You are almost too optimistic, I’m afraid,” said
Nick, with a smile. “We may not find him at Milmarsh.
Only, I think that he may be there. I have
reasons of my own for believing so, but they may all
turn out fallacious. There goes the train.”</p>

<p>In less than half an hour they were in a motor car,
hired at the station, and on their way up to the Milmarsh
mansion.</p>

<p>“Hello! What’s all the fuss on the porch?” exclaimed
Chick. “Look, chief! It isn’t the poor people
that were fooled on Paradise City there again, is it?”</p>

<p>“I see Billings moving about very actively,” said the
chief. “Hurry, driver! Let’s get there!”</p>

<p>The chauffeur put on more power and sent his machine
along at a headlong pace, which brought it up
in front of the porch at the main door with a rush.</p>

<p>“What is it?” shouted Nick, at Patsy Garvan, who
was by the side of the big truckman.</p>

<p>“The guy they called Howard Milmarsh is back
again,” was the reply hurled back by Patsy.</p>

<h2 id="XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br />
<small>WHERE THEY FOUND HIM.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter jumped out of the car, leaving to Chick
the congenial task of helping out Bessie Silvius, and
bolted into the house.</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“In the dining room, locked in with the others,”
reported Billings coolly. “As soon as he came snooping
up, I shoved him in with Louden Powers and
Lampton, and let them have it out between them. Then
I came out, to see who it was coming up the road in
an automobile. It was you. The other guy came
only just a little while ago.”</p>

<p>“You mean the man you have in the dining room?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He said he walked up from the station, talking
to another fellow who was with him, when suddenly
he missed him.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The other guy he was talking to.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that he allowed a man to get
away from him while they were actually talking, and
didn’t see where he’d gone?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he told us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it, for one,” put in Chick.</p>

<p>“Unless this mug in the dining room is daffy. Then
it might have happened,” suggested Patsy. “Who is
he, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Nick did not stop to answer, although he could
have done it. He went over to Bessie Silvius, and
asked her to wait in the drawing-room with her father,
for a little time, while he straightened out a little misunderstanding
that had occurred.</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Carter, is that Mr. Gordon in the dining
room? I mean, the man they say came walking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the road with somebody else? Or was it he who suddenly
left the other?”</p>

<p>“I shall have to go into the dining room to see the
man before I can answer that question.”</p>

<p>He directed Chick to stay in the drawing-room with
Bessie and her father. It was a mission that Chick
undertook with cheerfulness. Carter saw him leading
Bessie and Roscoe Silvius to the drawing-room with
Chesterfieldian politeness, and did not trouble any
further about him.</p>

<p>Billings opened the door of the dining room with
the key he had in his pocket, and Nick went in.</p>

<p>He saw just about what he expected. Louden Powers
and Andrew Lampton each had a cigar going, and
between them, still slumped down in his chair, as if
he never had moved, was the individual who had been
put forward as the real heir of the stupendous Milmarsh
estate.</p>

<p>Nick went to this man and shook him until he looked
up vacantly.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” demanded Nick.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I was bringing him here, because
you wanted him. But he wouldn’t come the whole
distance, and it was no fault of mine. I guess he is
somewhere about the grounds.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you search for him, instead of coming
up to the house?”</p>

<p>“Because I believed he’d come here. It is what
anybody would have believed. But as soon as I came
up to the porch, some of these fellows of yours saw
me and dragged me into this room.”</p>

<p>The speaker was not exactly stupid. He seemed to
be rather dazed by a rapid surge of events. That was
the way Nick regarded him, and doubtless he was
right. He bent over and whispered in the man’s ear.</p>

<p>The result was a brightening up, and a much firmer
tone of voice, as he said aloud:</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll go with you, and I reckon I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
find him, too. But you will have to keep these two men
off me,” pointing to Powers and Lampton. “They
feel that things are slipping away from them, and they
will kill me if they have a chance.”</p>

<p>“That is quite probable,” muttered the detective inaudibly.</p>

<p>He led the cowed man out of the room, and saw
that Patsy followed. He turned to his young assistant
and told him not to let anybody out of the house till
they returned.</p>

<p>Once in the open air, Nick’s companion seemed to
become a different man. His step was springy, and
when they came to a fence separating them from a
part of the ground that was full of high grass and
tangled shrubbery, he vaulted over it as lightly and
cleanly as Nick himself. His voice was almost firm,
as he said:</p>

<p>“I saw him looking over here as we came up the
road, and once I heard him mutter something about the
west meadow. He seemed to know that part of the
estate, although I did not hear him say anything else.”</p>

<p>“The west meadow,” repeated Nick. “Yes, I think I
know where that is.”</p>

<p>They walked for some little distance through the
bushes and grass, until the detective stopped and
pointed to what was evidently a recent trail.</p>

<p>“See! Somebody has walked through this high
grass and made a deep, wide furrow. We shan’t have
much trouble in finding him now, I think.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Nick was surprised to find that the trail
ended at the stone foundation wall of the house, at
the back, where the cover of the tunnel that used to be
part of the “underground railway” was made to look
like the surrounding stones. The tunnel has already
been described.</p>

<p>“Get in there!” commanded Carter.</p>

<p>The man was not inclined to obey. He seemed
to fear it meant getting him at a disadvantage—perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
locking him up in some dungeon from which
he might never emerge save to go into a regular prison.</p>

<p>But Nick was not in a mood to be held back by
anybody—least of all by one whom he felt had no
right to consideration.</p>

<p>So the man went down the chute, just as Chick
had, not so long before, and the detective followed
him.</p>

<p>There is no necessity to tell bit by bit how they went
along the secret corridor which finally brought them
to the back of the large picture in the dining room,
where Nick and his assistant had listened to the conversation
of the conspirators—one of whom was now
actually in the corridor himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly a man sprang out of the blackness and
seized Nick by the throat, forcing him backward and
almost to his knees.</p>

<p>It was only for an instant that the detective was held
at a disadvantage. He hurled his assailant away, and,
bringing out his pocket flash, saw the man who had
come with him lying on the floor in the narrow space,
while facing him, with wild, vengeful eyes, was the
sick man from the Universal Hospital!</p>

<p>It was evident that the escaped patient did not recognize
either Nick or the other man, and equally certain
that he regarded them both as enemies.</p>

<p>Even as the detective watched, he could see the
long fingers, lean and clawlike from long illness,
twitching to get at his throat, while the madman’s
feet shuffled slightly, as if preparing for a sudden
spring.</p>

<p>Nick took the initiative. Telling the man on the
floor to get up and lend a hand, he threw one arm
around the strange creature who had found his way
in some mysterious way to this secret corridor, and
seized his wrist from behind. By this wrestling trick,
the detective had both the hands of his captive firmly
held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold him for a moment!” he commanded the
other man, who had arisen by this time. “Poor fellow!
He is too weak to resist much. Had you any
notion where he was?”</p>

<p>“How could I have?” was the rejoinder, in an injured
tone. “I never was in this hole before. Where
are we, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>He felt along the wall until his linger touched a
small knob.</p>

<p>The next moment a panel turned open silently, and
they were looking through a doorway some four feet
wide, down into the dining room, where sat the men
they had left there half an hour before.</p>

<p>A shriek of horror burst from Andrew Lampton.
But Louden Powers only smiled derisively. He had an
iron nerve, and nothing could surprise him very much.
He had always known there were secret passages about
this strange old house, although he never had found
them for himself.</p>

<p>The appearance of the two ghostly personages in
the bedchamber on that night had confirmed what he
had heard about the hidden places in the house. So
it did not seem so very extraordinary that Nick Carter
should suddenly show himself in the wall, by two
of the large pictures.</p>

<p>At first only Nick was visible to the people in the
dining room. But, as he stepped forth upon a chair,
and thus to the door, he led the escaped sick man from
the hospital, while following him was the person the
two conspirators had declared to be Howard Milmarsh.</p>

<p>“What, chief?” shouted Patsy Garvan, in delight.
“Did you get him?”</p>

<p>“By hooky,” roared Bonesy Billings. “There’s two
of ’em! They look just alike! Now I know how you
told the truth, Mr. Carter, while it looked like—like
the other thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective only nodded, as he put a large chair
for the pale-faced invalid, and forced him into it
gently.</p>

<p>The belligerence had gone from the face of the
newcomer. He seemed to be wondering—that was all.</p>

<p>The most peculiar thing in the whole affair was that
the man who had been set forth as the real owner of
the Milmarsh estate, and who had appeared so dazed
and in such terror of Powers and Lampton, now held
up his head and actually smiled, as if a great weight
had been lifted from his shoulders.</p>

<p>Louden Powers scowled at him, but he replied only
by a stare of defiance.</p>

<p>“That mug is going to give the whole snap away,”
muttered Andrew Lampton, in the ear of his fellow
conspirator.</p>

<p>“I’ll kill him if he does,” whispered back Louden
Powers.</p>

<h2 id="XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br />
<small>THE RIGHTFUL HEIR.</small></h2>


<p>“Bring in that young lady and her father, with
Chick,” ordered the detective, as he swung the secret
panel shut and nodded to Patsy.</p>

<p>“Gi’ me the key, Bonesy.”</p>

<p>Billings unlocked the door, and, while Patsy was absent,
he stood guard. Not that it was needed, for
nobody made an attempt to get out.</p>

<p>“Here they are, chief!” cried Patsy, as he came in
with the three persons he had been sent for.</p>

<p>The girl would have run to the sick man as soon
as she saw him, and it could be seen that a cry of recognition
was ready to spring from her lips.</p>

<p>“Not yet!” warned Nick. “Patience for just a
moment!”</p>

<p>She nodded obediently and sank into the chair Chick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
set for her. Her father, bewildered, was already
seated.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen,” went on the detective, “in the
first place. I will ask this man, who has been posing
as Howard Milmarsh, what his name really is.”</p>

<p>“What is the use of my saying?” grumbled the man
he addressed. “You know it, and, of course, these
other fellows do.” He pointed to Louden Powers and
Andrew Lampton. “They thought it was a slick
game, and that we could get away with the bluff. I
knew we couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“You could, if you’d had any nerve,” snarled Louden
Powers. “But you never could see a thing
through. You are all right at the beginning. But you
haven’t the pluck to stay with a thing to the end.
You’re like a wet firecracker. There’s a whiz and a
puff, and you’re done! You make me sick, T. Burton
Potter!”</p>

<p>Potter smiled. He did not care what was said, now
that the truth had come out.</p>

<p>“Then, if this guy’s name is Potter, the other one
must be——” began Bonesy Billings.</p>

<p>Nick held up a hand to silence him. Then he whispered
to Bessie Silvius.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Carter,” she answered aloud. “I believe
he’ll know me. I’ll try him.”</p>

<p>She stepped over to the man who had spent so long
a time in the Universal Hospital, and laid a hand
on his arm. He started and looked at her.</p>

<p>“Bob!” she whispered. “Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p>It was very difficult for him to draw his senses together,
but it could be seen that her voice had touched
a responsive chord in his being. He held out his hand
to her.</p>

<p>As she took it, he murmured brokenly:</p>

<p>“Bob Gordon? Yes, that is what they call me. But—but—it
isn’t quite right. How is it—Bessie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed half hysterically.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that, Mr. Carter? He knows me!
He called me by my name! He is coming to himself!”</p>

<p>The detective shook his head doubtfully. He was
willing to admit that remembering the girl’s name
was a good sign, but it was not enough.</p>

<p>“Let me try,” he said.</p>

<p>Touching the young man on the shoulder, he bent
over and whispered sharply in his ear:</p>

<p>“Howard Milmarsh!”</p>

<p>There was a slight movement. But it could not be
said that the name had brought him to his senses. He
slumped down in his chair again, and in a weary
voice murmured: “Bessie!”</p>

<p>“The only thing he can think of,” remarked Chick.
“He’s a lucky man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see where the luck comes in, if he’s off his
nut,” rejoined Patsy.</p>

<p>Bonesy Billings, Chick and Patsy were all gathered
about him, each one watching for some other indications
of returning intelligence besides that contained
in the single word, “Bessie!”</p>

<p>It was this moment of which Louden Powers took
advantage. With a sign to Lampton, Louden crept
toward the door.</p>

<p>But Nick was on the alert, even though so deeply
engaged.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Louden!” he shouted, as he rushed forward
to cut off the rascal’s escape.</p>

<p>“Get back!” roared Powers. “You’d better, if you
don’t want to get this.”</p>

<p>He had picked up a heavy, cut-glass water bottle
from the table, and was swinging it around his head.</p>

<p>Nick dashed at him, and Louden let the bottle go
with all his force.</p>

<p>The detective ducked, and the bottle went past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>A shriek from Bessie Silvius made him turn quickly.</p>

<p>Howard Milmarsh—the real one—was lying back
in his chair, and a thin, red stream trickled over his
forehead.</p>

<p>“Get that fellow!” shouted Nick, over his shoulder,
as he rushed to the wounded man crumpled up in the
big armchair.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him, all right,” replied Bonesy Billings.</p>

<p>Billings had backheeled Louden Powers just as he
got to the door, and now was kneeling on the chest
of the discomfited scoundrel.</p>

<p>Lampton, scared, was in his chair. He had jumped
up when Louden tried to get away. Then, seeing that
the attempt would fail, he prudently resumed his seat
in a hurry.</p>

<p>Nick was examining the wound, putting his handkerchief
to it and noting at the same time that the
sufferer was talking rapidly.</p>

<p>“It just caught him with a glancing stroke,” announced
the detective. “It jarred him, but that is all.
It is not serious. Just enough of a concussion to——”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked around him, with a hopeful
look in his keen, dark eyes.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” the wounded man was saying, in a
natural, though weak, voice. “Are we off the roof?
Is the fire still burning? We didn’t go through, did
we? Where’s Bessie?”</p>

<p>“Here I am! Here I am!” she answered eagerly.</p>

<p>He took her hand and stared into her face. Then
he smiled. This time it was with as much intelligence
as her own.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter! Mr. Carter!” she screamed.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“He has got back his senses! Look at him!”</p>

<p>“Do you know who you are?” asked Nick, close to
him.</p>

<p>“Howard Milmarsh to you, Mr. Carter. Howard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Milmarsh! What is the use of my saying my name if
anything else? You know me. I don’t care who
knows it now, anyhow. I had determined to give myself
up. I killed Richard Jarvis.”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t. You’re mistaken. You did not
kill him,” declared the detective emphatically. “You
will take my word, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Take your word, Mr. Carter? Of course I will—I
must! But are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m sure. I can prove it.”</p>

<p>“Then is Richard Jarvis alive?”</p>

<p>“No. But he died by an accident—after he had
quite recovered from the blow you gave him. It was
only a knock-out. He came to in a few minutes. You
were scared unnecessarily. Now you will come into
your own.”</p>

<p>“But—my father? Ah, yes! I know! My poor
father!”</p>

<p>Tears—real, comforting, natural tears—flowed
from his eyes. They would have proved, if there had
been nothing else, that Howard Milmarsh was again
himself, and that he was prepared to face whatever
might be his fate.</p>

<p>Nick Carter turned away, to see what Bonesy was
doing to the prostrate, cursing Louden Powers.</p>

<p>“Take him away, Billings. Lock him up in a cellar,
till the police come.”</p>

<p>As Bonesy Billings promptly obeyed, by yanking
Louden Powers to his feet as if he had been a sack
of oats, Andrew Lampton exclaimed, in a terrified
tone:</p>

<p>“Police? Have you sent for the police?”</p>

<p>Nick waited till Louden Powers was out of the
room. Then he went close to Lampton, and spoke to
him quietly:</p>

<p>“Look here, Lampton. I promised that if you
brought T. Burton Potter to me, I would do something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
for you. I will keep my word by giving you half
an hour’s start of the police. Get out! I’d advise
you to get over the Canadian border as soon as you
can do it. Don’t ever show up in New York again.
If you do. I won’t answer for the consequences. Understand?”</p>

<p>Andrew Lampton did understand. He was out of
the house almost before the detective had finished
speaking.</p>

<p>“Are you going to bring any charge against me?”
whimpered T. Burton Potter. “Or may I go?”</p>

<p>“I know you are a crook, Potter. But in this case
I recognize that you were led into mischief by stronger
wills than your own. Your attempt to defraud Howard
Milmarsh of his rights would mean, perhaps, ten
years in Sing Sing if the charge were pressed. But
you helped me find the right man at last, and I believe
you are really sorry for what you have done.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And——”</p>

<p>“Get out of this house,” interrupted Nick. “The
same advice I gave to Andrew Lampton applies to you.
Lose no time in jumping over the line into Canada.
You may escape that way. It is your own lookout.
Go, and may you lead a better life in future.”</p>

<p>“I will!” returned T. Burton Potter earnestly. “I
have had such a scare this time that I’m through with
crookedness for all time.”</p>

<p>“I hope that’s true.”</p>

<p>“You bet it’s true,” insisted Potter, as he hurried
from the room.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that you’re letting all the crooks
get away, chief,” protested Chick mildly. “I think
both Potter and Lampton ought to have been handed
over to the police, with Powers.”</p>

<p>“Strictly speaking, according to the law, I suppose
they should,” conceded the chief. “But I have to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Howard Milmarsh. He has recovered his senses,
it is true—thanks to that bottle over there—but it will
be some time before it will be safe to put him through
another mental strain.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right.”</p>

<p>“Of course he’s right,” put in Patsy. “He’s always
right. It seems to me that you had a lot of nerve to
tell him he wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” interposed Nick, smiling. “I can’t
afford to have my two men—both of them the most
loyal lieutenants a man could have—arguing over
me.”</p>

<p>“But he said——” blurted out Patsy.</p>

<p>“I know what he said, and he was right, in a way.
But there are circumstances that make it desirable that
Howard Milmarsh should take possession of his estate
with as little fuss as possible. I promised his father
that I would see he was allowed to do so, and that’s
what I have to do.”</p>

<p class="asterism">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>It was three months after that exciting night at the
great Milmarsh mansion on the hill. Another night of
an exciting nature may be mentioned. The excitement
this time was of a much more pleasant kind, however.
The wedding of Howard Milmarsh and Bessie Silvius
had just taken place.</p>

<p>Nick Carter, Chick, and Patsy were all there, together
with Billings—who wore evening clothes, for
the first and only time in his life. Chick had been the
best man at the ceremony, and a niece of Captain
Brown’s was the bridesmaid.</p>

<p>Among the guests were all the people who had been
swindled over the Paradise City land project. They
had got back their money, with a large bonus to each
person in addition, and now were there to cheer the
finest man who ever had lived in that part of the
country, in their opinion, Howard Milmarsh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all right, so far as it goes,” remarked Patsy
Garvan to Chick, sotto voce, “but where would Howard
Milmarsh have been to-day if it were not for the
chief?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Chick. “Howard is like all of
us. He has to take off his hat to Nick Carter.”</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
